# Safety Infrastructure (Historical)

This directory contains the historical safety infrastructure that was developed during a major refactoring effort. It has been archived because it is no longer actively used by the current codebase.

## Archive Date
- **Archived**: January 7, 2025
- **Reason**: No active usage; replaced by standard development practices

## Contents Overview

### Safety Procedures
- `SAFETY_PROCEDURES.md` - Comprehensive safety guidelines for refactoring
- `VISUAL_REGRESSION_SUMMARY.md` - Visual regression testing documentation

### Python Scripts
- `api_contract_tests.py` - API contract validation tests
- `baseline_metrics.py` - Performance baseline capture
- `data_integrity_validator.py` - Data validation during refactoring
- `progress_tracker.py` - Sprint/refactoring progress tracking system
- `update_baseline_metadata.py` - Baseline update utilities
- `visual_regression_setup.py` - Visual testing setup

### Shell Scripts
- `emergency_rollback.sh` - Emergency rollback procedures
- `run_safety_checks.sh` - Automated safety check runner

### Data Files
- Various JSON files containing baseline metrics, API contracts, and data snapshots
- Progress reports from previous refactoring sessions

### Visual Baselines
- Screenshot baselines for UI regression testing
- Metadata for visual comparison

## Historical Context

This infrastructure was created to provide a comprehensive safety net during a major refactoring effort. It included:
- Automated safety checks before code changes
- Performance and API contract monitoring
- Visual regression testing
- Emergency rollback capabilities
- Go/no-go decision support

## Current Status

The current codebase uses standard development practices:
- Regular testing with pytest
- CI/CD pipelines for quality assurance
- Version control for rollback capabilities
- Standard monitoring and logging

## Note

While this infrastructure is no longer actively used, it represents a sophisticated approach to managing large-scale refactoring efforts and may provide valuable insights for future major changes.
