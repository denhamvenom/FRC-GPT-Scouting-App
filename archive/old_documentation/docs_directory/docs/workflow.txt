# Unified Scouting Assistant - Workflow (First Phase)

## INITIAL SETUP (First Load or New Season)

1. User loads app or selects "New Season Setup"
2. App asks for Game Manual PDF upload
3. App uses GPT to auto-generate full game schema:
   - Scoring objectives
   - Penalties
   - Ranking tiebreakers
   - Field elements
4. App pulls official events from Blue Alliance API
5. User selects active event (e.g., 2025neworleans)
6. App connects to user's active Google Scouting Sheet
7. App maps Scouting sheet headers via GPT (editable)
8. If enabled, app maps SuperScouting sheet headers via GPT

## FULL EVENT DATASET BUILDING

- Pull and parse Match Scouting Data (Google Sheets)
- Pull and parse SuperScouting Data (if enabled)
- Pull Static Blue Alliance Data:
  - List of teams
  - Full qualification match schedule
- Pull Static Statbotics Data:
  - EPA, OPR, DPR, CCWM at event start
- Merge all datasets into a Unified Event Dataset

---

## DYNAMIC DATA HANDLING (During Event)

- User can manually refresh "Fast Data" at any time:
  - Blue Alliance:
    - Team rankings
    - Total Ranking Points
    - Average Ranking Points
    - Average Auto/Teleop/Endgame points
    - Match scores per alliance
    - Match-by-match RP results
  - Statbotics:
    - Updated EPA, OPR, DPR
    - Auto EPA / Endgame EPA updates

- Merged into Unified Event Dataset live
- Push refreshed unified data back into Google Sheets (new tab)

## DATA TIERS

| Data Tier | Examples | Source | Pull Frequency |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Scouting Data | Match scouting form entries | Google Sheets | Manual by scouts |
| SuperScouting Data | Defense, strategy notes, penalties | Google Sheets | Manual (optional) |
| Static Event Data | Teams list, match schedule | Blue Alliance API | Once per event setup |
| Dynamic Event Data | Team rankings, RP, scores | Blue Alliance API | Refreshable |
| Dynamic Metrics | EPA, OPR, DPR, CCWM | Statbotics API | Refreshable |

---

## SYSTEM BEHAVIOR PRINCIPLES

- New Game = New Schema (yearly)
- New Event = New dynamic data pull
- Google Sheets remains backup/source-of-truth
- API data enhances but does not replace scouting
- Unified Event Dataset always rebuildable manually
