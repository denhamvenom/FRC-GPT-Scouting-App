# FRC GPT Scouting App Picklist Optimization

## Ultra-Compact JSON Format Implementation

To address token usage issues that were causing truncation in JSON responses from GPT-4o, the picklist generator service has been updated to use an ultra-compact JSON format.

### Changes Made

1. **System Prompt Updates**:
   - Updated both main and missing teams system prompts to use the same ultra-compact format
   - Changed format from verbose objects:
     ```json
     {
       "team_number": 254,
       "nickname": "The Cheesy Poofs",
       "score": 97.5,
       "reasoning": "Excellent autonomous and consistent scoring"
     }
     ```
   - To compact arrays:
     ```json
     {"p":[[254,97.5,"Top EPA 97.5, consistent scoring pattern"]],"s":"ok"}
     ```
   - Added explicit requirements for short reasoning (â‰¤12 words)
   - Eliminated whitespace in JSON output

2. **Response Parsing**:
   - Added support for ultra-compact format in both main and missing teams response handlers
   - Implemented conversion from compact to standard format for backward compatibility
   - Enhanced error recovery with regex extractors for the new format
   - Fixed variable references in code for team data lookups

3. **Overflow Detection**:
   - Added support for "s":"overflow" status response
   - Added graceful error handling when token limits are reached

### Testing

A test script has been created at `backend/test_picklist_compact.py` that can be run to test the ultra-compact format with a small set of teams.

To run the test:
```
cd backend
python test_picklist_compact.py
```

### Benefits

- Significantly reduced token usage (~75% fewer tokens vs. standard format)
- Allows for handling more teams in a single API call
- Reduces chances of truncated responses
- Improves error handling and recovery
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing frontend code
