4. Restore network connection
5. Retry comparison without modal reload
6. Verify recovery behavior

**Expected Results**:
- Clear error message displayed
- UI remains stable during failure
- Retry functionality works correctly
- No data corruption occurs

### Scenario 7: Invalid Team Data
**Objective**: Test handling of missing or corrupted data

**Test Steps**:
1. Select teams with incomplete statistical data
2. Attempt comparison
3. Verify graceful handling of missing metrics
4. Test with teams having zero data points
5. Verify error handling and user feedback

**Expected Results**:
- Missing data handled gracefully
- User informed of data limitations
- Comparison still provides available insights
- No application crashes

### Scenario 8: OpenAI API Timeout
**Objective**: Test handling of external service delays

**Test Steps**:
1. Simulate slow OpenAI API response
2. Initiate team comparison
3. Verify loading state shown during delay
4. Test timeout handling (if applicable)
5. Verify user feedback for long operations

**Expected Results**:
- Loading indicators shown appropriately
- Timeout handled gracefully
- User can cancel long operations
- State management remains consistent

## Performance Testing

### Scenario 9: Response Time Validation
**Objective**: Ensure performance within acceptable bounds

**Test Steps**:

  test('basic two-team comparison', async () => {
    // Automated version of Scenario 1
    await page.goto('/picklist');
    await page.check('[data-testid="team-checkbox-1234"]');
    await page.check('[data-testid="team-checkbox-5678"]');
    await page.click('[data-testid="compare-button"]');
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="comparison-modal"]')).toBeVisible();
    // ... continue test steps
  });
});
```

## Validation Checklist

### Pre-Refactoring Baseline Capture
- [ ] Complete all scenarios manually
- [ ] Record response times and behaviors
- [ ] Capture screenshots at each step
- [ ] Document any existing issues
- [ ] Establish performance benchmarks

### Post-Refactoring Validation
- [ ] Execute all scenarios again
- [ ] Compare against baseline behavior
- [ ] Verify visual preservation
- [ ] Validate performance metrics
- [ ] Confirm error handling unchanged

### Go/No-Go Decision Criteria

**PROCEED** only if:
- ✅ 100% of test scenarios pass
- ✅ Zero visual differences detected
- ✅ Performance within 5% of baseline
- ✅ No new errors introduced
- ✅ All browser compatibility maintained

**ROLLBACK** if any:
- ❌ Any test scenario fails
- ❌ Visual differences detected
- ❌ Performance degradation >5%
- ❌ New errors or crashes
- ❌ Browser compatibility issues

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **GPT Integration**: External dependency variability
2. **Complex State Management**: Modal and parent component interaction
3. **Dynamic Content**: Chat history and statistical calculations
4. **Performance**: Large dataset processing

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **API Mocking**: Test without external dependencies
2. **State Isolation**: Verify state cleanup and independence
3. **Data Validation**: Comprehensive edge case testing
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous benchmarking

This comprehensive test suite ensures that any refactoring of the Team Comparison workflow maintains exact functional and visual behavior while improving code quality.
