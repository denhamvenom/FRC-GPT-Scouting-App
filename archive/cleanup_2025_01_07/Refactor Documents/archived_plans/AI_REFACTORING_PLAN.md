# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE ⚠️

**This plan has been superseded by MASTER_REFACTORING_GUIDE.md**

**Reason for deprecation**: This plan was too aggressive with 10 sprints and did not adequately address visual preservation requirements or user role limitations.

# FRC Scouting App AI-Assisted Refactoring Plan (ARCHIVED)

## Document Version
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2025-06-22
- **Author**: AI-Refactor Architect
- **Status**: DEPRECATED - Archived on 2025-06-23

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive, AI-assisted refactoring plan for the FRC Scouting App. The plan addresses the failures of the previous refactoring attempt by implementing strict context preservation, checksum verification, and test-driven development practices.

### Key Improvements from Previous Attempt
1. **Immutable Baseline**: Create and maintain an unchanging reference branch
2. **Checksum Verification**: Every file modification verified against SHA-1 hashes
3. **Context Preservation**: Mandatory docstrings with full dependency information
4. **Sprint-Based Execution**: Small, testable increments with clear success criteria
5. **AI-Optimized Workflow**: Templates and guides for consistent AI assistance

## Project Overview

### Current State
- **Architecture**: Monolithic FastAPI backend + React frontend
- **Test Coverage**: 0% (no automated tests)
- **Code Quality**: Mixed patterns, 1000+ line services
- **Documentation**: Minimal inline documentation
- **Deployment**: Manual process, Docker-based

### Target State
- **Architecture**: Modular domain-driven design
- **Test Coverage**: 80%+ with CI/CD automation
- **Code Quality**: <300 line services, consistent patterns
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings, AI-readable
- **Deployment**: Automated with health checks and monitoring

## Sprint Schedule

### Phase 1: Foundation (Sprints 1-2)
**Duration**: 4 days
**Goal**: Establish testing infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline

#### Sprint 1: Test Framework Setup
- Install and configure pytest
- Generate initial test scaffolds
- Create test fixtures and utilities
- Document test patterns

#### Sprint 2: CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Docker optimization
- Automated testing on PR
- Code quality checks

### Phase 2: Backend Decomposition (Sprints 3-7)
**Duration**: 10 days
**Goal**: Modularize backend services

#### Sprint 3: Domain Model Extraction
- Extract business entities
- Create type definitions
- Add validation logic
- Unit test coverage

#### Sprint 4: Service Interface Definition
- Define service contracts
- Create abstract interfaces
- Document dependencies
- Integration test setup

#### Sprint 5: Picklist Service Refactoring
- Decompose monolithic service
- Preserve all functionality
- Maintain API compatibility
- Performance testing

#### Sprint 6: Security Implementation
- API middleware layer
- Authentication/authorization
- Rate limiting
- Input validation

#### Sprint 7: Infrastructure Abstraction
- Unified caching layer
- External API clients
- Database repositories
- Configuration management

### Phase 3: Integration (Sprints 8-9)
**Duration**: 4 days
**Goal**: System integration and monitoring

#### Sprint 8: Observability
- OpenTelemetry setup
- Health check endpoints
- Logging standardization
- Metrics collection

#### Sprint 9: Frontend Integration
- TypeScript types from API
- API client generation
- Error handling
- Loading states

### Phase 4: Validation (Sprint 10)
**Duration**: 2 days
**Goal**: Full system validation

#### Sprint 10: End-to-End Testing
- Complete integration tests
- Performance benchmarking
- Bug fixes
- Documentation updates

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **Context Loss**: Mitigated by checksums and comprehensive docstrings
2. **Functionality Regression**: Mitigated by parallel testing and baseline comparison
3. **Performance Degradation**: Mitigated by benchmarking and profiling
4. **Integration Failures**: Mitigated by incremental changes and extensive testing

### Mitigation Strategies
- Maintain working baseline branch at all times
- Run old and new systems in parallel during test events
- Automated rollback procedures
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
- Test coverage ≥ 80%
- API response time < 200ms (p95)
- Zero functionality loss
- All existing features working
- Successful deployment at both test events

### Qualitative Metrics
- Improved code maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent coding patterns
- Comprehensive documentation
- Easy onboarding for new developers

## Resource Requirements

### Human Resources
- 1-2 developers for code review
- Team volunteers for testing at events
- Project owner for acceptance testing

### Technical Resources
- GitHub repository access
- API keys (OpenAI, TBA, Google)
- Development environment
- CI/CD infrastructure

## Communication Plan

### Sprint Updates
- Daily progress logged in sprint documents
- Issues tracked in GitHub
- Test results published automatically
- Weekly summary for stakeholders

### Escalation Path
1. Sprint blockers → Project owner
2. Technical decisions → Senior developer
3. Resource needs → Team leadership
