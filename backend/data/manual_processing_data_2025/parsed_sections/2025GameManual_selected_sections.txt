5 ARENA  
The ARENA includes all elements of the game infrastructure that are required to play REEFSCAPESM presented 
by Haas: the FIELD, SCORING ELEMENTS, queue area, team media area, designated TECHNICIAN area, and all 
equipment needed for FIELD control, ROBOT control, and scorekeeping. 
Figure 5-1 REEFSCAPE ARENA (queue area, TECHNICIAN area, and media area not pictured) 
 
The ARENA is modular and assembled, used, disassembled, and shipped many times during the competition 
season. It undergoes wear and tear. The ARENA is designed to withstand rigorous play and frequent shipping. 
Every effort is made to ensure that ARENAS are consistent from event to event. However, ARENAS are 
assembled in different venues by different event staff and some small variations occur. For details regarding 
assembly tolerances, please refer to the 2025 ARENA Layout and Marking Diagram. Successful teams will 
design ROBOTS that are insensitive to these variations. 
Illustrations included in this section are for a general visual understanding of the REEFSCAPE ARENA, and 
dimensions included in the manual are nominal. Please refer to the official drawings for exact dimensions, 
tolerances, and construction details. The official drawings, CAD models, and drawings for low-cost versions of 
important elements of the REEFSCAPE FIELD are posted on the REEFSCAPE Playing FIELD web page on the 
FIRST website. 
5.1 FIELD 
Each FIELD for REEFSCAPE is an approximately 26 ft. 5 in. (~805 cm) by 57 ft. 6⅞ in. (~1 755 cm) carpeted 
area bounded by inward facing surfaces of the ALLIANCE WALLS, CORAL STATIONS, PROCESSORS and 
PROCESSOR openings, and guardrails.

Figure 5-2 FIELD boundary in pink 
 
The FIELD is populated with and surrounded by the following elements:  
− 
1 REEF per ALLIANCE,  
− 
1 PROCESSOR per ALLIANCE,  
− 
2 CORAL STATIONS per ALLIANCE, and  
− 
1 BARGE which consists of 3 CAGES and 1 NET for each ALLIANCE. 
The surface of the FIELD is low pile carpet, Shaw Floors, Philadelphia Commercial, Neyland II 20, “66561 
Medallion.” Neyland II carpet is not available for purchase, and the closest equivalent is Shaw, Philadelphia 
Brand, Profusion 20, Style 54933; see results from FIRST’s evaluation in this blog post.  
Carpet edges and seams are secured with 3MTM Premium Matte Cloth (Gaffers) Tape GT2, GT3 or comparable 
Gaffer’s Tape. Tears, rips, and damage to the carpet may be repaired with the same styles of tape and ROBOTS 
must be prepared to operate on surfaces made of carpet, tape, or combinations of both materials as repairs 
are made through the course of competition. 
Guardrails form the long edges of the FIELD. Guardrails are a 1 ft. 8 in. (~51 cm) tall system of transparent 
polycarbonate supported on the top and bottom by aluminum extrusion. There are 4 gates in the guardrail that 
allow access to the FIELD for placement and removal of ROBOTS. The gate passthrough, when open, is 3 ft. 2 
in. (~97 cm) wide. Gates are closed and shielded during the MATCH.

There are 2 versions of guardrails and DRIVER STATIONS used for competitions. 1 design is reflected in the 
2025 Official FIRST FIELD Drawings & Models. The other is designed and sold by AndyMark. While the designs 
are slightly different, the critical dimensions, performance, and expected user experience between them are the 
same unless otherwise noted. Detailed drawings for the AndyMark design are posted on the AndyMark 
website. All illustrations in this manual show the traditional FIELD design. 
5.2 Areas, Zones, & Markings  
FIELD areas, zones, and markings of consequence are described below. Unless otherwise specified, the tape 
used to mark lines and zones throughout the FIELD is 2 in. (~51 mm) 3M™ Premium Matte Cloth (Gaffers) 
Tape (GT2), ProGaff® Premium Professional Grade Gaffer Tape, or comparable gaffers tape.

Figure 5-5 REEF 
 
A REEF is 1 of 2 5 ft. 5 ½ in. (~166 cm) hexagonal structures with BRANCHES that extend from each side 
where CORAL are scored. Each ALLIANCE has a dedicated REEF centered between each guardrail and located 
12 ft. away from the ALLIANCE WALL. Each REEF has 4 levels to score on: Level 1 (L1), Level 2 (L2), Level 3 
(L3), and Level 4 (L4). 
Figure 5-6: Scoring Level Locations (L1-L4) 
 
The base of each REEF has a trough (L1) into which ROBOTS can score CORAL. The trough includes the 
angled and vertical surfaces, as well as the top of the front edge as shown in Figure 5-7. The front edge of the 
trough is 1 ft. 6 in. (~46 cm) off the carpet.

Figure 5-7: Trough Surfaces 
 
Vertical pipes extend up from the base, and pipes on the same face are 1 ft. 1 in. (~33 cm) apart (center to 
center). The pipes are made out of 1-¼ in. Schedule 40 Steel. Each pipe has 3 BRANCHES which are angled or 
compound extensions from the REEF vertical pipes. 
L2 is the 12 lowest level BRANCHES and are angled up at 35°. The highest point of the L2 BRANCH is 2 ft. 7⅞ 
in. (~81 cm) from the carpet and is inset 1⅝ in. (~41 mm) from the REEF base. 
L3 is the 12 mid-level BRANCHES and are angled up at 35°. The highest point of the L3 BRANCH is 3 ft. 11⅝ in. 
(~121 cm) from the carpet and is inset 1⅝ in. (~41 mm) from the REEF base. 
L4 is the 12 highest-level BRANCHES and they are vertical. The highest point of the L4 BRANCH is 6 ft. (~183 
cm) from the carpet and is inset 1⅛ in. (~29 mm) from the REEF base.   
For scoring purposes, the BRANCHES of the REEF are tracked in FMS as follows:

5.4 BARGE 
Figure 5-9 BARGE 
 
The BARGE is a 29 ft. 2 in. (889 cm) wide, 3 ft. 8 in. (~112 cm) deep, and 8 ft. 5 in. (~257 cm) tall structure that 
spans the center of the FIELD. It is made of truss structure supported by legs just outside the guardrail. The 
BARGE includes 6 CAGES, a red and blue NET, and all structure supporting CAGES and NETS. The horizontal 
truss structure is 5 ft. 2 in. (~157 cm) above the carpet and is supported in the center of the FIELD by vertical 
truss and supporting materials. The BARGE has three CAGE locations on each side located 3 ft. 5½ in., 7 ft. ⅜ 
in., 10 ft. 7⅜ in. (~105 cm, ~214 cm, ~324 cm) from mid field to the center of the CAGE. 
The BARGE has three segments of lights on each side of the truss which indicate progression toward and 
completion of the Coopertition Bonus and the final 20 seconds in the match. One segment will light up each 
time an ALGAE is scored in the PROCESSOR. Once each alliance has scored two ALGAE all six segments will 
illuminate. The lights will flash to indicate that there are 20 seconds left in the match. At the end of the match, 
the lights will illuminate and then turn off 3 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP to 
help indicate to REFEREES when scoring assessments should be made.

Figure 5-13: PROCESSOR 
 
A PROCESSOR is a goal into which an ALLIANCE scores ALGAE. There is 1 PROCESSOR per ALLIANCE. The 
PROCESSOR is integrated into the guardrail near the ALLIANCE’S REEF ZONE and adjacent to the opponent’s 
PROCESSOR AREA. Each PROCESSOR has a rectangular opening through which ROBOTS score ALGAE which 
is 2 ft. 4 in. wide (~71 cm), 1 ft. 8 in. tall (~51 cm), and 7 in. (~18 cm) from the carpet.  
Once an ALGAE passes through the PROCESSOR, it rolls past a scoring sensor array and into the opponent’s 
PROCESSOR AREA. The HUMAN PLAYER must keep the PROCESSOR clear for scoring, and can shift scored 
ALGAE on top of the PROCESSOR where there are designated ALGAE holders.

5.6.2 CORAL STATION 
Figure 5-18 CORAL STATION 
 
A CORAL STATION is an assembly through which HUMAN PLAYERS feed CORAL into the FIELD. There are 4 
CORAL STATIONS, 1 in each corner of the FIELD connecting the guardrail to the ALLIANCE WALL. Each CORAL 
STATION has a 6 ft. 4 in. wide by 7 in. tall (~193 cm wide by ~18 cm tall) opening through which CORAL 
passes to the FIELD; the bottom of the opening is 3 ft. 1½ in. (~95 cm) from the carpet. A 55° sloped tunnel, 
called the CHUTE, leads to the opening in the CORAL STATION.  
There are 2 stools available at events for DRIVE TEAMS to use. Each stool is 1 ft. 
11 in. (~58 cm) wide by 1 ft. 1½ in. (~34 cm) deep, 6¼ in. (~16 cm) tall, and rated 
for 300 lbs. (~136 kg). 
It is specially intended to allow individuals who are shorter, better sightlines onto 
the FIELD; however, this accommodation is available to anyone who has another 
physical disability that obstructs their view of the FIELD. Due to space 
constraints, stools are not allowed to be used in the PROCESSOR AREA. 
Only 2 stools are available, and priority will be given to those with the biggest 
need. Teams should speak to the FTA before MATCHES begin to request that it 
is available for each of the team’s MATCHES. Teams may also purchase their 
own (Item Number: 779ac01stpm) or bring an equivalent (e.g. not foldable and 
similar dimensions) version to the event to guarantee use for every match.  
This stool is available at all events within the US & Canada and equivalents are 
available at international events. For questions, please connect with the local 
Program Delivery Partner. 
5.7 SCORING ELEMENTS 
SCORING ELEMENTS are items that teams use to score additional points. There are 2 types of SCORING 
ELEMENTS used in REEFSCAPE: CORAL and ALGAE.

5.7.1 CORAL 
Figure 5-19 CORAL 
 
A CORAL is a 11 ⅞ in. long (~30 cm) piece of 4 in. diameter Schedule 40 Cellular (Foam) Core PVC pipe. 
CORAL has a 4-in. (~102 mm) inside diameter and a 4½-in. (~11 cm) outside diameter. CORAL is available for 
purchase from AndyMark, am-5601 or can be cut from longer lengths of 4 in. diameter Schedule 40 Cellular 
(Foam) Core PVC pipe.  
Prior to Kickoff, CORAL was known as “Game Piece 1” and not available for pre-
order prior to the season. 
CORAL in the KOP and at events has a weight of between 1.1-1.8 lbs. (~0.5-0.8 kg) and has text marking along 
the length of the pipe that may vary in color.  
Teams should be aware that CORAL and PVC pipe from different sources may 
have variances in color, markings, and weight.  
CORAL undergoes wear and tear during a competition. Generally, a CORAL that still appears to look 
approximately like a CORAL is considered a CORAL for the purposes of rule evaluation and scoring, whether 
damaged or not. Small chunks of a CORAL are not considered a CORAL. 
The edge of the CORAL may be rough or sharp. Teams should use caution when 
handling CORAL.

5.7.2 ALGAE 
Figure 5-20: ALGAE 
 
Each ALGAE is a 16.25 in. (~413 mm) ± ¼ in. (~6 mm) diameter rubber playground ball. The ball is custom 
made for FIRST by Baden Sports and sold by AndyMark am-5602. 
Prior to Kickoff, ALGAE was known as “Game Piece 2” and was available for pre-
order prior to the season.  
At events, ALGAE will be inflated using a sizing gauge so that the diameter measures between 16 in. (~406 
mm) and 16.5 in. (~419 mm). The ALGAE and the jig will both be placed on a flat surface, and the ALGAE will 
be inflated with the valve sticking up vertically so that the seam is perpendicular to the large hole in the jig. It 
will be inflated until the two opposite points along the seam are contacting the top edge of the hole in the jig, 
which is 16.25 in. (~413 mm) diameter. 
The tolerances to which ALGAE are manufactured allow for variances in 
diameter, wall thickness, weight distribution and overall weight. They may not 
always be uniformly spherical, roll straight, or bounce as expected.

6 Game Details 
Figure 6-1 REEFSCAPE 
 
In REEFSCAPE, 2 ALLIANCES (an ALLIANCE is a cooperative of up to 4 FIRST Robotics Competition teams) 
play MATCHES, set up and implemented per the details described below.  
6.1 MATCH Overview 
MATCHES run on 7–10-minute cycles, which consist of pre-MATCH setup, the 2-minute and 30-second 
MATCH, and the post-MATCH reset. 
During the MATCH, ROBOTS collect CORAL and score on their REEF. ROBOTS also collect ALGAE and score in 
their PROCESSOR or NET. HUMAN PLAYERS can score ALGAE in their NET once it has been passed to them 
via their opponent’s PROCESSOR.  
ROBOTS conclude the MATCH PARKING in their BARGE ZONE or suspending from a CAGE. 
6.2 DRIVE TEAM 
A DRIVE TEAM is a set of up to 5 people from the same FIRST Robotics Competition team responsible for 
team performance for a specific MATCH. There are 4 specific roles on a DRIVE TEAM which ALLIANCES can 
use to assist ROBOTS with REEFSCAPE, and no more than 1 member of the DRIVE TEAM may be a non-
STUDENT.  
The intent of the definition of DRIVE TEAM and DRIVE TEAM related rules is that, 
barring extenuating circumstances, the DRIVE TEAM consists of people who 
arrived at the event affiliated with that team and are responsible for their team’s 
and ROBOT’S performance at the event (this means a person may be affiliated

and TELEOP for scoring purposes as described in section 6.5 Scoring. 
The second phase of each MATCH is the remaining 2 minutes and 15 seconds (2:15) and called the 
Teleoperated Period (TELEOP). During TELEOP, DRIVERS remotely operate ROBOTS to retrieve and score 
SCORING ELEMENTS and climb their CAGES. 
6.5 Scoring  
ALLIANCES are rewarded for accomplishing various actions throughout a MATCH, including LEAVING their 
ROBOT STARTING LINE, scoring CORAL on their REEF, scoring ALGAE in their PROCESSOR and NET, climbing 
CAGES, and winning or tying MATCHES. 
Rewards are granted either via MATCH points, Coopertition points, or Ranking Points (often abbreviated to RP, 
which increase the measure used to rank teams in the Qualification Tournament).  
All scores are assessed and updated throughout the MATCH, except as follows:  
A. assessment of CORAL scored on the REEF and ALGAE scored in the PROCESSOR or NET continues for 
up to 3 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following AUTO. 
B. assessment of CORAL scored on the REEF and ALGAE scored in the PROCESSOR or NET continues for 
up to 3 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP. 
C. assessment of CAGE points is made 3 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP, 
or when all ROBOTS have come to rest following the conclusion of the MATCH, whichever happens 
first. 
LEAVING the ROBOT STARTING LINE, CORAL scoring, ALGAE scoring in the NET, 
PARKING and CAGE points are all evaluated and scored by human volunteers. 
Teams are encouraged to make sure that it is obvious and unambiguous that the 
criteria are met. 
6.5.1 SCORING ELEMENT Scoring Criteria 
A CORAL is scored in the trough (L1) of the REEF if it is not in contact with a ROBOT on that ALLIANCE, not 
scored on any other level of the REEF, and 
A. contacting the trough, or 
B. directly supported (either fully or partially) by a CORAL in contact with the trough.

Figure 6-5 Examples of CORAL scored in the trough (L1) 
 
Figure 6-5 includes examples of CORAL on the REEF at the conclusion of a 
MATCH.  
A. CORAL A, C, F, and H are scored because they meet criteria A. 
B. CORAL B and G are scored because they meet criteria B. 
C. CORAL D and E do not meet any criteria for trough scoring. 
 
A CORAL is scored on L2-L4 BRANCH if the BRANCH is inside the volume of the CORAL and the CORAL is not 
in contact with a ROBOT on that ALLIANCE or an ALGAE. Only 1 CORAL can be scored per BRANCH. 
An ALGAE is scored in a PROCESSOR once it has passed through the opening of the PROCESSOR and by the 
sensor array. An ALGAE is scored in a NET if it is above the NET and within the perimeter of the NET, 
contacting the NET or ALGAE contacting the NET, and not in contact with a ROBOT on that ALLIANCE. 
If a CORAL scored in AUTO gets removed from a BRANCH during TELEOP, the AUTO points are removed but 
the CORAL will still count towards the AUTO RP. If a CORAL is scored in that location again, the AUTO points 
associated with the original scored CORAL is restored. CORAL scored in the trough is not tracked by specific 
location, if a CORAL is removed from the trough after AUTO, the points removed will correspond to the lowest 
scoring CORAL (i.e. TELEOP CORAL removed first); if CORAL is re-scored in the trough, points will be re-added 
in the reverse order (i.e. AUTO CORAL re-added first). 
6.5.2 ROBOT Scoring Criteria 
To qualify for LEAVE points, a ROBOT must move such that its BUMPERS no longer overlap its ROBOT 
STARTING LINE at the end of AUTO.  
To qualify for PARK points, a ROBOT’S BUMPERS must be partially or completely contained in their BARGE 
ZONE at the end of the MATCH and does not meet the criteria for CAGE points. 

 
Section 6 Game Details 
V13 
49 of 164 
To qualify for CAGE points, a ROBOT must be contacting one and only one of their ALLIANCE’S CAGES (and 
not touching any ANCHOR), not contacting the carpet, and may additionally contact only the following 
elements: 
A. SCORING ELEMENTS, 
B. another ROBOT qualified for CAGE points,  
C. a partner ROBOT contacted by an opponent in violation of G428, and 
D. an opponent ROBOT. 
6.5.3 Coopertition Bonus 
In Qualification MATCHES, if at least 2 ALGAE are scored in each ALLIANCE’S PROCESSOR, all teams earn 1 
Coopertition Point, and the threshold for the CORAL RP decreases as described in Table 6-2.

Violation: If fix is a quick remedy, the MATCH won’t start until all requirements are met. If it is not a quick 
remedy, DISABLED and, at the discretion of the Head REFEREE, must be re-inspected. If a ROBOT not 
compliant with part B or C participates, its team receives a RED CARD. 
If a ROBOT is BYPASSED prior to the start of the MATCH, the DRIVE TEAM may 
not remove the ROBOT from the FIELD without permission from the Head 
REFEREE or the FTA. 
For assessment of many of the items listed above, the Head REFEREE is likely to 
consult with the LRI. 
7.4 In-MATCH 
Rules in this section pertain to game play once a MATCH begins.  
7.4.1 AUTO 
The AUTO period is the first 15 seconds of the MATCH, and the FMS blocks any DRIVER control, so ROBOTS 
operate with only their pre-programmed instructions. Rules in this section apply only during the AUTO period.  
G401 *Behind the lines. In AUTO, each DRIVE TEAM member must remain in their staged areas. A DRIVE 
TEAM member staged behind a HUMAN STARTING LINE may not contact anything in front of that 
HUMAN STARTING LINE, unless for personal or equipment safety, to press the E-Stop or A-Stop, or 
granted permission by a Head REFEREE or FTA.  
Violation: MINOR FOUL regardless of the number of items contacted. 
Pointing, gesturing, or otherwise extending across the HUMAN STARTING LINE 
such that contact is not made with carpet or other ARENA elements is not a 
violation of this rule. 
An example of an exception for equipment safety is if an OPERATOR CONSOLE 
starts to fall from, or has already fallen off of, the DRIVER STATION shelf. In that 
circumstance, DRIVE TEAM members may step forward to catch it or pick it up 
off the ground and return it to the shelf. 
G402 *Let the ROBOT do its thing. In AUTO, a DRIVE TEAM member may not directly or indirectly interact 
with a ROBOT or an OPERATOR CONSOLE unless for personal safety, OPERATOR CONSOLE safety, or 
pressing an E-Stop or A-Stop. A HUMAN PLAYER feeding CORAL to a ROBOT is an exception to this 
rule.  
Violation: MINOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD  
G403 Limited AUTO opponent interaction. In AUTO, a ROBOT whose BUMPERS are completely across the 
BARGE ZONE (i.e. to the opposite side of the BARGE ZONE from its ROBOT STARTING LINE) may not 
contact an opponent ROBOT (either directly or transitively through a SCORING ELEMENT CONTROLLED 
by either ROBOT and regardless of who initiates contact).  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during the event. 
G404 No throwing in AUTO. In AUTO, a HUMAN PLAYER may not enter ALGAE onto the field.  
Violation: MINOR FOUL. 
G405 No opponents CAGES in AUTO. In AUTO, a ROBOT may not contact an opposing ALLIANCE’s CAGE.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL. 

 
Section 7 Game Rules (G) 
V11 
66 of 164 
7.4.2 SCORING ELEMENTS 
G406 *ROBOTS: use SCORING ELEMENTS as directed. A ROBOT may not deliberately use a SCORING 
ELEMENT in an attempt to ease or amplify a challenge associated with a FIELD element.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL.  
Examples include, but are not limited to:  
A. launching SCORING ELEMENTS at ROBOTS, 
B. using SCORING ELEMENTS to elevate ROBOTS in an attempt to get on a 
CAGE, 
C. positioning SCORING ELEMENTS to impede opponent access to their 
PROCESSOR, 
D. Placing a CORAL into the PROCESSOR, and 
E. Using CORAL to dislodge ALGAE from the REEF  
G407 *Keep SCORING ELEMENTS in bounds. A ROBOT may not intentionally eject a SCORING ELEMENT 
from the FIELD (either directly or by bouncing off a FIELD element or other ROBOT) other than ALGAE 
through a PROCESSOR.  
Violation: MINOR FOUL. If REPEATED, MAJOR FOUL. 
G408 *Don’t abuse SCORING ELEMENTS. Neither a ROBOT nor a HUMAN PLAYER may damage a SCORING 
ELEMENT.  
Violation: VERBAL WARNING. MAJOR FOUL if REPEATED in any subsequent MATCHES during the event. If 
via a ROBOT and the Head REFEREE determines that further damage is likely to occur, DISABLED. 
Corrective action (such as eliminating sharp edges, removing the damaging MECHANISM, and/or re-
inspection) may be required before the ROBOT may compete in subsequent MATCHES. 
SCORING ELEMENTS are expected to undergo a reasonable amount of wear and 
tear as they are handled by ROBOTS, such as scratching or marking. Routinely 
gouging, tearing off pieces, or marking SCORING ELEMENTS are violations of 
this rule. 
G409 1 of each at a time. A ROBOT may not simultaneously CONTROL more than 1 CORAL and 1 ALGAE 
either directly or transitively through other objects. A ROBOT is in CONTROL of a SCORING ELEMENT if  
A. the SCORING ELEMENT is fully supported by or stuck in, on, or under the ROBOT or  
B. the ROBOT intentionally pushes a SCORING ELEMENT to a desired location or in a preferred 
direction (i.e. herding).  
A ROBOT pushing scored CORAL on level 1 while attempting to score other CORAL is an exception to 
this rule. 
Violation: MINOR FOUL per additional SCORING ELEMENT. YELLOW CARD if excessive. 
Examples of interaction with a SCORING ELEMENT that are not “CONTROL” 
include, but are not limited to: 
A. “bulldozing” (inadvertent contact with a SCORING ELEMENT while in the path 
of the ROBOT moving about the FIELD) 
B. “deflecting” (being hit by a SCORING ELEMENT that bounces into or off a 
ROBOT) 
C. inadvertent contact with a SCORING ELEMENT while attempting to acquire a 
SCORING ELEMENT from the CORAL STATION. 

 
Section 7 Game Rules (G) 
V11 
67 of 164 
It is important to design your ROBOT so that it is impossible to inadvertently or 
unintentionally CONTROL more than the limit. 
Excessive violations of CONTROL limits include, but are not limited to, 
simultaneous CONTROL of 3 or more CORAL or frequent, greater-than-
MOMENTARY CONTROL (i.e. more than twice in a MATCH) of 2 or more CORAL.  
G410 No de-scoring. A ROBOT may not de-score a CORAL scored on the opponent’s REEF.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL per de-scored CORAL and the opposing ALLIANCE is awarded the CORAL RP. 
G411 Don’t put ALGAE on their REEF. A ROBOT may not deliberately put ALGAE on their opponent’s REEF.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD. 
G412 Only throw CORAL if in your REEF ZONE. A ROBOT may not launch CORAL unless their BUMPERS are 
partially in their REEF ZONE. 
Violation: MAJOR FOUL. 
A CORAL is considered launched if it is shot into the air, kicked across the floor 
to a desired location or in a preferred direction, or thrown in a forceful way. 
“Bulldozing” (inadvertent contact with a SCORING ELEMENT while in the path of 
the ROBOT moving about the FIELD) is not considered launching. 
This rule is not intended to penalize typical movement of CORAL outside an 
ALLIANCE’S REEF ZONE which come to rest a short distance (approximately 3 ft. 
(~92cm)) from the ROBOT. Examples of such actions could be but are not 
limited to: 
A. Running an intake in reverse causing a CORAL to travel a short distance from 
the ROBOT 
B. A ROBOT pushing a CORAL a short distance away in the process of herding it 
across the FIELD 
7.4.3 ROBOT 
G413 *ROBOTS must be safe. A ROBOT may not pose an undue hazard to a human, an ARENA element, or 
another ROBOT in the following ways: 
A. the ROBOT or anything it CONTROLS, e.g. a CORAL, contacts anything outside the FIELD except 
for MOMENTARY contact inside the CHUTE,  
B. its BUMPERS fail such that a segment completely detaches,  
C. a corner of its ROBOT PERIMETER is exposed,  
D. its team number or ALLIANCE color are indeterminate,  
E. its BUMPERS leave the BUMPER ZONE REPEATEDLY or for more than a MOMENTARY amount 
of time, or 
F. its operation or design is dangerous or unsafe. 
Violation: DISABLED. 
Examples of dangerous operation or designs that likely pose undue hazards 
include, but are not limited to: 
A. uncontrolled motion that cannot be stopped by the DRIVE TEAM, 
B. ROBOT parts “flailing” outside of the FIELD, 
C. ROBOTS dragging their battery, and 
D. ROBOTS that consistently extend outside the FIELD. 

 
Section 7 Game Rules (G) 
V11 
68 of 164 
Please be conscious of REFEREES and FIELD STAFF working around the ARENA 
who may be in close proximity to your ROBOT. 
G414 *Keep your BUMPERS low. BUMPERS must be in the BUMPER ZONE (see R405).  
Violation: MINOR FOUL.  
G415 Expansion limits. A ROBOT may not extend more than 1 ft. 6 in. (~45 cm) beyond the vertical projection 
of its ROBOT PERIMETER.  
If the over-expansion is due to damage and not used for strategic benefit, it is an exception to this rule, 
and no penalty is imposed. 
Violation: MINOR FOUL, or MAJOR FOUL if the over-expansion is used for strategic benefit, including if it 
impedes or enables a scoring action. 
Examples of compliant and non-compliant extensions are shown in Figure 7-2. 
ROBOT A violates this rule for having an extension that is too long, while ROBOTS 
B, C, and D do not violate this rule. 
Figure 7-2 Examples of compliance and non-compliance of this rule (examples A and B are side views, 
examples C and D are top views) 
 
The intent of this rule is to prevent piling on a punitive response to a ROBOT 
that’s already experienced hardship and not leveraging that hardship for gain. 
Examples for this rule include the following:  
A. 
a physical device on a team’s ROBOT, whose purpose is to restrain their 
CORAL scoring arm from extending beyond the limit, breaks after a 
collision with another ROBOT. Provided the ROBOT does not use the now-
too-long extension to score SCORING ELEMENTS, no violation is assigned.  
B. 
a vertical structural member of a ROBOT breaks at the bottom and rotates 
out such that it breaches the limit imposed. The ROBOT then parks such 
that its extension blocks opponent ROBOTS from reaching their 
PROCESSOR. A MAJOR FOUL is issued.  

 
Section 7 Game Rules (G) 
V11 
69 of 164 
G416 Don’t damage the FIELD. A ROBOT may not damage FIELD elements. 
Violation: VERBAL WARNING. If the Head REFEREE infers that additional damage is likely, DISABLED. 
YELLOW CARD for any subsequent damage during the event. Corrective action (such as eliminating sharp 
edges, removing the damaging MECHANISM, and/or re-inspection) may be required before the ROBOT will 
be allowed to compete in subsequent MATCHES. 
G417 Watch your FIELD interaction. A ROBOT is prohibited from the following interactions with FIELD 
elements with the exception of CAGES. 
A. grabbing, 
B. grasping, 
C. attaching to (including the use of a vacuum or hook fastener to anchor to the FIELD carpet), 
D. becoming entangled with, and 
E. suspending from.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL, plus YELLOW CARD if REPEATED, or longer than MOMENTARY. If the Head 
REFEREE infers that damage is likely, DISABLED. Corrective action (such as removing the offending 
MECHANISM, and/or re-inspection) may be required before the ROBOT will be allowed to compete in 
subsequent MATCHES. 
G418 An Opponent’s CAGES are off-limits in TELEOP. In TELEOP, A ROBOT may not contact an opponent’s 
CAGE.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and opposing ALLIANCE is awarded the BARGE RP if a Qualification MATCH. 
G419 ANCHORS are off-limits. A ROBOT may not contact the ANCHORS. Exceptions are granted for actions 
that are inconsequential. 
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and the ROBOT is ineligible for CAGE points. 
The intent of this rule is to disallow the use of the ANCHOR to ease the climbing 
challenge.  
Examples of contact with the ANCHOR that are considered inconsequential 
include, but are not limited to:  
A. bumping into the ANCHOR during an attempt to climb 
B. inadvertent contact while attempting to PARK 
C. inadvertent contact while driving through the BARGE ZONE 
Examples of contact with the ANCHOR that are considered consequential 
include, but are not limited to: 
D. Reacting against the ANCHOR to lift off the floor 
E. Reacting against the ANCHOR to stabilize the ROBOT (It is possible that 
certain interactions with the ANCHOR that absorb ROBOT energy may still be 
considered inconsequential.) 
F. Overtly contacting the ANCHOR to stop the movement of the CAGE (It is 
possible that certain interactions with the ANCHOR that absorb ROBOT 
energy may be still be considered inconsequential.) 
G420 NET and contents are off-limits. A ROBOT may not contact either NET or any ALGAE scored in an 
opponent NET.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL. Additional MAJOR FOUL for each opponent ALGAE de-scored. 

 
Section 7 Game Rules (G) 
V11

G421 1 defender at a time. No more than 1 ROBOT may be on the opponent’s side of the FIELD (i.e. 
containing the opponent REEF) with its BUMPERS fully outside and beyond the BARGE ZONES. 
Violation: MINOR FOUL, and for every 3 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a MAJOR FOUL is 
assessed. 
7.4.4 Opponent Interaction 
Note, G422, G423, G424 are mutually exclusive. A single ROBOT to ROBOT interaction which violates more 
than 1 of these rules results in the most punitive penalty, and only the most punitive penalty, being assessed. 
G422 *Stay out of other ROBOTS. A ROBOT may not use a COMPONENT outside its ROBOT PERIMETER 
(except its BUMPERS) to initiate contact with an opponent ROBOT inside the vertical projection of the 
opponent’s ROBOT PERIMETER.  
Violation: MINOR FOUL. 
For the purposes of this rule, “initiate contact” requires movement towards an 
opponent ROBOT.  
In a collision, it’s possible for both ROBOTS to initiate contact. 
G423 *This isn’t combat robotics. A ROBOT may not damage or functionally impair an opponent ROBOT in 
either of the following ways: 
A. deliberately. 
B. regardless of intent, by initiating contact, either directly or transitively via a SCORING ELEMENT 
CONTROLLED by the ROBOT, inside the vertical projection of an opponent’s ROBOT 
PERIMETER.  
Damage or functional impairment because of contact with a tipped-over opponent ROBOT, which is not 
perceived by a REFEREE to be deliberate, is not a violation of this rule. 
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD, or if opponent ROBOT is unable to drive, then MAJOR FOUL 
and RED CARD. 
FIRST Robotics Competition can be a full-contact competition and may include 
rigorous game play. While this rule aims to limit severe damage to ROBOTS, 
teams should design their ROBOTS to be robust. 
Examples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to: 
A. A ROBOT leaves an arm extended, spins around to change course, and 
unintentionally hits and damages a COMPONENT inside the ROBOT 
PERIMETER of a nearby opponent ROBOT. 
B. A ROBOT, in the process of trying to quickly reverse direction, tips up on a 
single pair of wheels, lands atop an opponent ROBOT, and damages a 
COMPONENT inside that opponent’s ROBOT PERIMETER. 
C. A ROBOT high-speed rams and/or REPEATEDLY smashes an opponent 
ROBOT and causes damage. The REFEREE infers that the ROBOT was 
deliberately trying to damage the opponent’s ROBOT. 
Examples of functionally impairing another ROBOT include, but are not limited to: 
D. opening an opponent’s relief valve such that the opponent’s air pressure 
drops and 
E. powering off an opponent’s ROBOT (this example also clearly results in a RED 
CARD because the ROBOT is no longer able to drive). 

 
Section 7 Game Rules (G)

At the conclusion of the MATCH, the Head REFEREE may elect to visually inspect 
a ROBOT to confirm violations of this rule made during a MATCH and remove the 
violation if the damage cannot be verified. 
For the purposes of this rule, “initiating contact” requires movement towards an 
opponent ROBOT.  
In a collision, it’s possible for both ROBOTS to initiate contact. 
"Unable to drive" means that because of the incident, the DRIVER can no longer 
drive to a desired location in a reasonable time (generally). For example, if a 
ROBOT can only move in circles, or can only move extremely slowly, the ROBOT 
is considered unable to drive. 
G424 *Don’t tip or entangle. A ROBOT may not deliberately, attach to, tip, or entangle with an opponent 
ROBOT.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD, or if CONTINUOUS or opponent ROBOT is unable to drive, 
then MAJOR FOUL and RED CARD.  
Examples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to: 
A. using a wedge-like MECHANISM to tip over opponent ROBOTS, 
B. making BUMPER-to-BUMPER contact with an opponent ROBOT that is 
attempting to right itself after previously falling over and causing them to fall 
over again, and  
C. causing an opponent ROBOT to tip over by contacting the ROBOT after it 
starts to tip if, in the judgement of the REFEREE, that contact could have been 
avoided. 
Tipping as an unintended consequence of normal ROBOT to ROBOT interaction, 
including single BUMPER to BUMPER hits that result in a ROBOT tipping, is not a 
violation of this rule. 
"Unable to drive" means that because of the incident, the DRIVER can no longer 
drive to a desired location in a reasonable time (generally). For example, if a 
ROBOT can only move in circles, or can only move extremely slowly, the ROBOT 
is considered unable to drive. 
G425 *There’s a 3-count on PINS. A ROBOT may not PIN an opponent’s ROBOT for more than 3 seconds. A 
ROBOT is PINNING if it is preventing the movement of an opponent ROBOT by contact, either direct or 
transitive (such as against a FIELD element). A PIN count ends once any of the following criteria below 
are met:  
A. the ROBOTS have separated by at least 6 ft. (~183 cm) from each other for more than 3 
seconds, 
B. either ROBOT has moved 6 ft. from where the PIN initiated for more than 3 seconds, or 
C. the PINNING ROBOT gets PINNED.  
For criteria A, the PIN count pauses once ROBOTS are separated by 6 ft. until either the PIN ends or the 
PINNING ROBOT moves back within 6 ft., at which point the PIN count is resumed.  
For criteria B, the PIN count pauses once either ROBOT has moved 6ft from where the PIN initiated until 
the PIN ends or until both ROBOTS move back within 6ft., at which point the PIN count is resumed. 
Violation: MINOR FOUL, and for every 3 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a MAJOR FOUL is 
assessed. 

 
Section 7 Game Rules (G)

72 of 164 
A team’s desired direction of travel is not a consideration when determining if a 
ROBOT is PINNED. 
G426 *Don’t collude with your partners to shut down major parts of game play. 2 or more ROBOTS that 
appear to a REFEREE to be working together may not isolate or close off any major element of MATCH 
play.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL, and for every 3 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a MAJOR FOUL is 
assessed. 
Examples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to:  
A. shutting down access to all SCORING ELEMENTS,   
B. quarantining all opponents to a small area of the FIELD,  
C. blocking all access to the opponent’s PROCESSOR, and  
D. blocking all access to the opponent’s CAGES. 
A single ROBOT blocking access to a particular area of the FIELD is not a 
violation of this rule. 
2 ROBOTS independently playing defense on 2 opponent ROBOTS is not a 
violation of this rule.  
G427 ZONE protection. A ROBOT may not contact, directly or transitively through a SCORING ELEMENT, an 
opponent ROBOT partially or fully inside the opponent’s BARGE ZONE or REEF ZONE regardless of who 
initiates contact.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL. 
ROBOTS that contact each other while in their respective BARGE ZONES may 
result in a violation for both ALLIANCES 
G428 CAGE protection. A ROBOT may not contact, directly or transitively through a SCORING ELEMENT, an 
opponent ROBOT in contact with an opponent CAGE during the last 20 seconds regardless of who 
initiates contact.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and the opponent ALLIANCE is awarded the BARGE RP 
7.4.5 Human 
G429 *No wandering. A DRIVE TEAM member must remain in their designated area as follows:  
A. DRIVERS and COACHES may not contact anything outside their ALLIANCE AREA, 
B. a DRIVER must use the OPERATOR CONSOLE in the DRIVER STATION to which they are 
assigned, as indicated on the team sign,  
C. a HUMAN PLAYER may not contact anything outside their ALLIANCE AREA or their PROCESSOR 
AREA, and  
D. a TECHNICIAN may not contact anything outside their designated area.  
Exceptions are granted as follows:  
E. for a HUMAN PLAYER partially outside the ALLIANCE or PROCESSOR AREA,  
F. in cases concerning safety, and  
G. for actions that are inadvertent, MOMENTARY, and inconsequential. 
Violation: MINOR FOUL 

 
Section 7 Game Rules (G) 
V11

An intent of item B is to prevent unsafe situations where long tethers to 
OPERATOR CONSOLE devices increase tripping hazards as the operator moves 
about the ALLIANCE AREA. In the interest of avoiding nuisance penalties 
associated with a DRIVE TEAM member stepping outside of a prescribed area, 
we prefer to offer a general guideline as to what it means to use the OPERATOR 
CONSOLE in the ALLIANCE AREA. Provided the DRIVE TEAM member is within 
close proximity of their DRIVER STATION, there will be no repercussions. 
However, a DRIVE TEAM member located more than approximately half a 
DRIVER STATION width away from their own DRIVER STATION while using their 
OPERATOR CONSOLE is likely violating this rule. 
G430 *COACHES and other teams: hands off the controls. A ROBOT shall be operated only by the DRIVERS 
and/or HUMAN PLAYERS of that team. A COACH activating their E-Stop or A-Stop is the exception to 
this rule. 
Violation: MAJOR FOUL. RED CARD if greater-than-MOMENTARY. 
Exceptions may be made before a MATCH for major conflicts, e.g. religious 
holidays, major testing, transportations issues, etc. 
G431 *DRIVE TEAMS, watch your reach. A DRIVE TEAM member may not extend into the CHUTE.   
Violation: MINOR FOUL.  
G432 *Humans: use SCORING ELEMENTS as directed. A DRIVE TEAM member may not deliberately use a 
SCORING ELEMENT in an attempt to ease or amplify a challenge associated with a FIELD element.   
Violation: MAJOR FOUL.  
Examples include, but are not limited to: 
A. a HUMAN PLAYER uses an ALGAE to disrupt an opponent ROBOT 
G433 *SCORING ELEMENT delivery. SCORING ELEMENTS may only be entered onto the FIELD as follows:  
A. CORAL may only be introduced to the FIELD by a HUMAN PLAYER or DRIVER through the CORAL 
STATION and 
B. ALGAE may only be entered onto the FIELD by a HUMAN PLAYER in their PROCESSOR AREA. 
Violation: MAJOR FOUL.  
G434 *COACHES, SCORING ELEMENTS are off limits. COACHES may not touch SCORING ELEMENTS, unless 
for safety purposes. 
Violation: MINOR FOUL. 
G435 The PROCESSOR AREA has a storage limit. HUMAN PLAYERS may not store more than 4 ALGAE in the 
PROCESSOR AREA. ALGAE can only be stored in the following locations: 
A. 3 in the holders on top of the PROCESSOR, and  
B. 1 at the end of the PROCESSOR exit ramp  
HUMAN PLAYERS making a good-faith effort to immediately move or enter additional ALGAE is an 
exception to this rule.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL per additional ALGAE.

Section 7 Game Rules (G) 
V11 
65 of 164 
Violation: If fix is a quick remedy, the MATCH won’t start until all requirements are met. If it is not a quick 
remedy, DISABLED and, at the discretion of the Head REFEREE, must be re-inspected. If a ROBOT not 
compliant with part B or C participates, its team receives a RED CARD. 
If a ROBOT is BYPASSED prior to the start of the MATCH, the DRIVE TEAM may 
not remove the ROBOT from the FIELD without permission from the Head 
REFEREE or the FTA. 
For assessment of many of the items listed above, the Head REFEREE is likely to 
consult with the LRI. 
7.4 In-MATCH 
Rules in this section pertain to game play once a MATCH begins.  
7.4.1 AUTO 
The AUTO period is the first 15 seconds of the MATCH, and the FMS blocks any DRIVER control, so ROBOTS 
operate with only their pre-programmed instructions. Rules in this section apply only during the AUTO period.  
G401 *Behind the lines. In AUTO, each DRIVE TEAM member must remain in their staged areas. A DRIVE 
TEAM member staged behind a HUMAN STARTING LINE may not contact anything in front of that 
HUMAN STARTING LINE, unless for personal or equipment safety, to press the E-Stop or A-Stop, or 
granted permission by a Head REFEREE or FTA.  
Violation: MINOR FOUL regardless of the number of items contacted. 
Pointing, gesturing, or otherwise extending across the HUMAN STARTING LINE 
such that contact is not made with carpet or other ARENA elements is not a 
violation of this rule. 
An example of an exception for equipment safety is if an OPERATOR CONSOLE 
starts to fall from, or has already fallen off of, the DRIVER STATION shelf. In that 
circumstance, DRIVE TEAM members may step forward to catch it or pick it up 
off the ground and return it to the shelf. 
G402 *Let the ROBOT do its thing. In AUTO, a DRIVE TEAM member may not directly or indirectly interact 
with a ROBOT or an OPERATOR CONSOLE unless for personal safety, OPERATOR CONSOLE safety, or 
pressing an E-Stop or A-Stop. A HUMAN PLAYER feeding CORAL to a ROBOT is an exception to this 
rule.  
Violation: MINOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD  
G403 Limited AUTO opponent interaction. In AUTO, a ROBOT whose BUMPERS are completely across the 
BARGE ZONE (i.e. to the opposite side of the BARGE ZONE from its ROBOT STARTING LINE) may not 
contact an opponent ROBOT (either directly or transitively through a SCORING ELEMENT CONTROLLED 
by either ROBOT and regardless of who initiates contact).  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during the event. 
G404 No throwing in AUTO. In AUTO, a HUMAN PLAYER may not enter ALGAE onto the field.  
Violation: MINOR FOUL. 
G405 No opponents CAGES in AUTO. In AUTO, a ROBOT may not contact an opposing ALLIANCE’s CAGE.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL.

Section 7 Game Rules (G) 
V11

7.4.2 SCORING ELEMENTS 
G406 *ROBOTS: use SCORING ELEMENTS as directed. A ROBOT may not deliberately use a SCORING 
ELEMENT in an attempt to ease or amplify a challenge associated with a FIELD element.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL.  
Examples include, but are not limited to:  
A. launching SCORING ELEMENTS at ROBOTS, 
B. using SCORING ELEMENTS to elevate ROBOTS in an attempt to get on a 
CAGE, 
C. positioning SCORING ELEMENTS to impede opponent access to their 
PROCESSOR, 
D. Placing a CORAL into the PROCESSOR, and 
E. Using CORAL to dislodge ALGAE from the REEF  
G407 *Keep SCORING ELEMENTS in bounds. A ROBOT may not intentionally eject a SCORING ELEMENT 
from the FIELD (either directly or by bouncing off a FIELD element or other ROBOT) other than ALGAE 
through a PROCESSOR.  
Violation: MINOR FOUL. If REPEATED, MAJOR FOUL. 
G408 *Don’t abuse SCORING ELEMENTS. Neither a ROBOT nor a HUMAN PLAYER may damage a SCORING 
ELEMENT.  
Violation: VERBAL WARNING. MAJOR FOUL if REPEATED in any subsequent MATCHES during the event. If 
via a ROBOT and the Head REFEREE determines that further damage is likely to occur, DISABLED. 
Corrective action (such as eliminating sharp edges, removing the damaging MECHANISM, and/or re-
inspection) may be required before the ROBOT may compete in subsequent MATCHES. 
SCORING ELEMENTS are expected to undergo a reasonable amount of wear and 
tear as they are handled by ROBOTS, such as scratching or marking. Routinely 
gouging, tearing off pieces, or marking SCORING ELEMENTS are violations of 
this rule. 
G409 1 of each at a time. A ROBOT may not simultaneously CONTROL more than 1 CORAL and 1 ALGAE 
either directly or transitively through other objects. A ROBOT is in CONTROL of a SCORING ELEMENT if  
A. the SCORING ELEMENT is fully supported by or stuck in, on, or under the ROBOT or  
B. the ROBOT intentionally pushes a SCORING ELEMENT to a desired location or in a preferred 
direction (i.e. herding).  
A ROBOT pushing scored CORAL on level 1 while attempting to score other CORAL is an exception to 
this rule. 
Violation: MINOR FOUL per additional SCORING ELEMENT. YELLOW CARD if excessive. 
Examples of interaction with a SCORING ELEMENT that are not “CONTROL” 
include, but are not limited to: 
A. “bulldozing” (inadvertent contact with a SCORING ELEMENT while in the path 
of the ROBOT moving about the FIELD) 
B. “deflecting” (being hit by a SCORING ELEMENT that bounces into or off a 
ROBOT) 
C. inadvertent contact with a SCORING ELEMENT while attempting to acquire a 
SCORING ELEMENT from the CORAL STATION. 



--- Section: 7.4.3 ROBOT (Page 67) ---
 
Section 7 Game Rules (G) 
V11 
67 of 164 
It is important to design your ROBOT so that it is impossible to inadvertently or 
unintentionally CONTROL more than the limit. 
Excessive violations of CONTROL limits include, but are not limited to, 
simultaneous CONTROL of 3 or more CORAL or frequent, greater-than-
MOMENTARY CONTROL (i.e. more than twice in a MATCH) of 2 or more CORAL.  
G410 No de-scoring. A ROBOT may not de-score a CORAL scored on the opponent’s REEF.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL per de-scored CORAL and the opposing ALLIANCE is awarded the CORAL RP. 
G411 Don’t put ALGAE on their REEF. A ROBOT may not deliberately put ALGAE on their opponent’s REEF.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD. 
G412 Only throw CORAL if in your REEF ZONE. A ROBOT may not launch CORAL unless their BUMPERS are 
partially in their REEF ZONE. 
Violation: MAJOR FOUL. 
A CORAL is considered launched if it is shot into the air, kicked across the floor 
to a desired location or in a preferred direction, or thrown in a forceful way. 
“Bulldozing” (inadvertent contact with a SCORING ELEMENT while in the path of 
the ROBOT moving about the FIELD) is not considered launching. 
This rule is not intended to penalize typical movement of CORAL outside an 
ALLIANCE’S REEF ZONE which come to rest a short distance (approximately 3 ft. 
(~92cm)) from the ROBOT. Examples of such actions could be but are not 
limited to: 
A. Running an intake in reverse causing a CORAL to travel a short distance from 
the ROBOT 
B. A ROBOT pushing a CORAL a short distance away in the process of herding it 
across the FIELD 
7.4.3 ROBOT 
G413 *ROBOTS must be safe. A ROBOT may not pose an undue hazard to a human, an ARENA element, or 
another ROBOT in the following ways: 
A. the ROBOT or anything it CONTROLS, e.g. a CORAL, contacts anything outside the FIELD except 
for MOMENTARY contact inside the CHUTE,  
B. its BUMPERS fail such that a segment completely detaches,  
C. a corner of its ROBOT PERIMETER is exposed,  
D. its team number or ALLIANCE color are indeterminate,  
E. its BUMPERS leave the BUMPER ZONE REPEATEDLY or for more than a MOMENTARY amount 
of time, or 
F. its operation or design is dangerous or unsafe. 
Violation: DISABLED. 
Examples of dangerous operation or designs that likely pose undue hazards 
include, but are not limited to: 
A. uncontrolled motion that cannot be stopped by the DRIVE TEAM, 
B. ROBOT parts “flailing” outside of the FIELD, 
C. ROBOTS dragging their battery, and 
D. ROBOTS that consistently extend outside the FIELD. 

 
Section 7 Game Rules (G) 
V11 
68 of 164 
Please be conscious of REFEREES and FIELD STAFF working around the ARENA 
who may be in close proximity to your ROBOT. 
G414 *Keep your BUMPERS low. BUMPERS must be in the BUMPER ZONE (see R405).  
Violation: MINOR FOUL.  
G415 Expansion limits. A ROBOT may not extend more than 1 ft. 6 in. (~45 cm) beyond the vertical projection 
of its ROBOT PERIMETER.  
If the over-expansion is due to damage and not used for strategic benefit, it is an exception to this rule, 
and no penalty is imposed. 
Violation: MINOR FOUL, or MAJOR FOUL if the over-expansion is used for strategic benefit, including if it 
impedes or enables a scoring action. 
Examples of compliant and non-compliant extensions are shown in Figure 7-2. 
ROBOT A violates this rule for having an extension that is too long, while ROBOTS 
B, C, and D do not violate this rule. 
Figure 7-2 Examples of compliance and non-compliance of this rule (examples A and B are side views, 
examples C and D are top views) 
 
The intent of this rule is to prevent piling on a punitive response to a ROBOT 
that’s already experienced hardship and not leveraging that hardship for gain. 
Examples for this rule include the following:  
A. 
a physical device on a team’s ROBOT, whose purpose is to restrain their 
CORAL scoring arm from extending beyond the limit, breaks after a 
collision with another ROBOT. Provided the ROBOT does not use the now-
too-long extension to score SCORING ELEMENTS, no violation is assigned.  
B. 
a vertical structural member of a ROBOT breaks at the bottom and rotates 
out such that it breaches the limit imposed. The ROBOT then parks such 
that its extension blocks opponent ROBOTS from reaching their 
PROCESSOR. A MAJOR FOUL is issued.  

 
Section 7 Game Rules (G) 
V11 
69 of 164 
G416 Don’t damage the FIELD. A ROBOT may not damage FIELD elements. 
Violation: VERBAL WARNING. If the Head REFEREE infers that additional damage is likely, DISABLED. 
YELLOW CARD for any subsequent damage during the event. Corrective action (such as eliminating sharp 
edges, removing the damaging MECHANISM, and/or re-inspection) may be required before the ROBOT will 
be allowed to compete in subsequent MATCHES. 
G417 Watch your FIELD interaction. A ROBOT is prohibited from the following interactions with FIELD 
elements with the exception of CAGES. 
A. grabbing, 
B. grasping, 
C. attaching to (including the use of a vacuum or hook fastener to anchor to the FIELD carpet), 
D. becoming entangled with, and 
E. suspending from.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL, plus YELLOW CARD if REPEATED, or longer than MOMENTARY. If the Head 
REFEREE infers that damage is likely, DISABLED. Corrective action (such as removing the offending 
MECHANISM, and/or re-inspection) may be required before the ROBOT will be allowed to compete in 
subsequent MATCHES. 
G418 An Opponent’s CAGES are off-limits in TELEOP. In TELEOP, A ROBOT may not contact an opponent’s 
CAGE.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and opposing ALLIANCE is awarded the BARGE RP if a Qualification MATCH. 
G419 ANCHORS are off-limits. A ROBOT may not contact the ANCHORS. Exceptions are granted for actions 
that are inconsequential. 
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and the ROBOT is ineligible for CAGE points. 
The intent of this rule is to disallow the use of the ANCHOR to ease the climbing 
challenge.  
Examples of contact with the ANCHOR that are considered inconsequential 
include, but are not limited to:  
A. bumping into the ANCHOR during an attempt to climb 
B. inadvertent contact while attempting to PARK 
C. inadvertent contact while driving through the BARGE ZONE 
Examples of contact with the ANCHOR that are considered consequential 
include, but are not limited to: 
D. Reacting against the ANCHOR to lift off the floor 
E. Reacting against the ANCHOR to stabilize the ROBOT (It is possible that 
certain interactions with the ANCHOR that absorb ROBOT energy may still be 
considered inconsequential.) 
F. Overtly contacting the ANCHOR to stop the movement of the CAGE (It is 
possible that certain interactions with the ANCHOR that absorb ROBOT 
energy may be still be considered inconsequential.) 
G420 NET and contents are off-limits. A ROBOT may not contact either NET or any ALGAE scored in an 
opponent NET.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL. Additional MAJOR FOUL for each opponent ALGAE de-scored.

G421 1 defender at a time. No more than 1 ROBOT may be on the opponent’s side of the FIELD (i.e. 
containing the opponent REEF) with its BUMPERS fully outside and beyond the BARGE ZONES. 
Violation: MINOR FOUL, and for every 3 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a MAJOR FOUL is 
assessed. 
7.4.4 Opponent Interaction 
Note, G422, G423, G424 are mutually exclusive. A single ROBOT to ROBOT interaction which violates more 
than 1 of these rules results in the most punitive penalty, and only the most punitive penalty, being assessed. 
G422 *Stay out of other ROBOTS. A ROBOT may not use a COMPONENT outside its ROBOT PERIMETER 
(except its BUMPERS) to initiate contact with an opponent ROBOT inside the vertical projection of the 
opponent’s ROBOT PERIMETER.  
Violation: MINOR FOUL. 
For the purposes of this rule, “initiate contact” requires movement towards an 
opponent ROBOT.  
In a collision, it’s possible for both ROBOTS to initiate contact. 
G423 *This isn’t combat robotics. A ROBOT may not damage or functionally impair an opponent ROBOT in 
either of the following ways: 
A. deliberately. 
B. regardless of intent, by initiating contact, either directly or transitively via a SCORING ELEMENT 
CONTROLLED by the ROBOT, inside the vertical projection of an opponent’s ROBOT 
PERIMETER.  
Damage or functional impairment because of contact with a tipped-over opponent ROBOT, which is not 
perceived by a REFEREE to be deliberate, is not a violation of this rule. 
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD, or if opponent ROBOT is unable to drive, then MAJOR FOUL 
and RED CARD. 
FIRST Robotics Competition can be a full-contact competition and may include 
rigorous game play. While this rule aims to limit severe damage to ROBOTS, 
teams should design their ROBOTS to be robust. 
Examples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to: 
A. A ROBOT leaves an arm extended, spins around to change course, and 
unintentionally hits and damages a COMPONENT inside the ROBOT 
PERIMETER of a nearby opponent ROBOT. 
B. A ROBOT, in the process of trying to quickly reverse direction, tips up on a 
single pair of wheels, lands atop an opponent ROBOT, and damages a 
COMPONENT inside that opponent’s ROBOT PERIMETER. 
C. A ROBOT high-speed rams and/or REPEATEDLY smashes an opponent 
ROBOT and causes damage. The REFEREE infers that the ROBOT was 
deliberately trying to damage the opponent’s ROBOT. 
Examples of functionally impairing another ROBOT include, but are not limited to: 
D. opening an opponent’s relief valve such that the opponent’s air pressure 
drops and 
E. powering off an opponent’s ROBOT (this example also clearly results in a RED 
CARD because the ROBOT is no longer able to drive). 

 
Section 7 Game Rules (G) 
V11 
71 of 164 
At the conclusion of the MATCH, the Head REFEREE may elect to visually inspect 
a ROBOT to confirm violations of this rule made during a MATCH and remove the 
violation if the damage cannot be verified. 
For the purposes of this rule, “initiating contact” requires movement towards an 
opponent ROBOT.  
In a collision, it’s possible for both ROBOTS to initiate contact. 
"Unable to drive" means that because of the incident, the DRIVER can no longer 
drive to a desired location in a reasonable time (generally). For example, if a 
ROBOT can only move in circles, or can only move extremely slowly, the ROBOT 
is considered unable to drive. 
G424 *Don’t tip or entangle. A ROBOT may not deliberately, attach to, tip, or entangle with an opponent 
ROBOT.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD, or if CONTINUOUS or opponent ROBOT is unable to drive, 
then MAJOR FOUL and RED CARD.  
Examples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to: 
A. using a wedge-like MECHANISM to tip over opponent ROBOTS, 
B. making BUMPER-to-BUMPER contact with an opponent ROBOT that is 
attempting to right itself after previously falling over and causing them to fall 
over again, and  
C. causing an opponent ROBOT to tip over by contacting the ROBOT after it 
starts to tip if, in the judgement of the REFEREE, that contact could have been 
avoided. 
Tipping as an unintended consequence of normal ROBOT to ROBOT interaction, 
including single BUMPER to BUMPER hits that result in a ROBOT tipping, is not a 
violation of this rule. 
"Unable to drive" means that because of the incident, the DRIVER can no longer 
drive to a desired location in a reasonable time (generally). For example, if a 
ROBOT can only move in circles, or can only move extremely slowly, the ROBOT 
is considered unable to drive. 
G425 *There’s a 3-count on PINS. A ROBOT may not PIN an opponent’s ROBOT for more than 3 seconds. A 
ROBOT is PINNING if it is preventing the movement of an opponent ROBOT by contact, either direct or 
transitive (such as against a FIELD element). A PIN count ends once any of the following criteria below 
are met:  
A. the ROBOTS have separated by at least 6 ft. (~183 cm) from each other for more than 3 
seconds, 
B. either ROBOT has moved 6 ft. from where the PIN initiated for more than 3 seconds, or 
C. the PINNING ROBOT gets PINNED.  
For criteria A, the PIN count pauses once ROBOTS are separated by 6 ft. until either the PIN ends or the 
PINNING ROBOT moves back within 6 ft., at which point the PIN count is resumed.  
For criteria B, the PIN count pauses once either ROBOT has moved 6ft from where the PIN initiated until 
the PIN ends or until both ROBOTS move back within 6ft., at which point the PIN count is resumed. 
Violation: MINOR FOUL, and for every 3 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a MAJOR FOUL is 
assessed.

A team’s desired direction of travel is not a consideration when determining if a 
ROBOT is PINNED. 
G426 *Don’t collude with your partners to shut down major parts of game play. 2 or more ROBOTS that 
appear to a REFEREE to be working together may not isolate or close off any major element of MATCH 
play.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL, and for every 3 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a MAJOR FOUL is 
assessed. 
Examples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to:  
A. shutting down access to all SCORING ELEMENTS,   
B. quarantining all opponents to a small area of the FIELD,  
C. blocking all access to the opponent’s PROCESSOR, and  
D. blocking all access to the opponent’s CAGES. 
A single ROBOT blocking access to a particular area of the FIELD is not a 
violation of this rule. 
2 ROBOTS independently playing defense on 2 opponent ROBOTS is not a 
violation of this rule.  
G427 ZONE protection. A ROBOT may not contact, directly or transitively through a SCORING ELEMENT, an 
opponent ROBOT partially or fully inside the opponent’s BARGE ZONE or REEF ZONE regardless of who 
initiates contact.  
Violation: MAJOR FOUL.

Section 7 Game Rules (G) 
V11 
73 of 164 
An intent of item B is to prevent unsafe situations where long tethers to 
OPERATOR CONSOLE devices increase tripping hazards as the operator moves 
about the ALLIANCE AREA. In the interest of avoiding nuisance penalties 
associated with a DRIVE TEAM member stepping outside of a prescribed area, 
we prefer to offer a general guideline as to what it means to use the OPERATOR 
CONSOLE in the ALLIANCE AREA. Provided the DRIVE TEAM member is within 
close proximity of their DRIVER STATION, there will be no repercussions. 
However, a DRIVE TEAM member located more than approximately half a 
DRIVER STATION width away from their own DRIVER STATION while using their 
OPERATOR CONSOLE is likely violating this rule. 
G430 *COACHES and other teams: hands off the controls. A ROBOT shall be operated only by the DRIVERS 
and/or HUMAN PLAYERS of that team. A COACH activating their E-Stop or A-Stop is the exception to 
this rule. 
Violation: MAJOR FOUL. RED CARD if greater-than-MOMENTARY. 
Exceptions may be made before a MATCH for major conflicts, e.g. religious 
holidays, major testing, transportations issues, etc. 
G431 *DRIVE TEAMS, watch your reach. A DRIVE TEAM member may not extend into the CHUTE.   
Violation: MINOR FOUL.  
G432 *Humans: use SCORING ELEMENTS as directed. A DRIVE TEAM member may not deliberately use a 
SCORING ELEMENT in an attempt to ease or amplify a challenge associated with a FIELD element.   
Violation: MAJOR FOUL.  
Examples include, but are not limited to: 
A. a HUMAN PLAYER uses an ALGAE to disrupt an opponent ROBOT 
G433 *SCORING ELEMENT delivery. SCORING ELEMENTS may only be entered onto the FIELD as follows:  
A. CORAL may only be introduced to the FIELD by a HUMAN PLAYER or DRIVER through the CORAL
