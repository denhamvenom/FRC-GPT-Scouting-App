4 Game Overview 
 
In REEFSCAPESM presented by Haas, two competing alliances are invited to score coral, harvest algae, and 
attach to the barge before time runs out. Alliances earn additional rewards for meeting specific scoring 
thresholds and for cooperating with their opponents.  
During the first 15 seconds of the match, robots are autonomous. Without guidance from their drivers, robots 
leave their starting zone, score coral on the reef, harvest algae from the reef, and collect and score additional 
coral. 
During the remaining 2 minutes and 15 seconds, drivers control their robots. Robots collect coral from human 
players at their coral station and score them on the reef. To unlock all scoring locations on the reef, robots 
must dislodge algae from the reef and either score it in the barge or deliver it to the human player through the 
processor. 
A human player can then deliver the algae to the barge. If at least two algae are scored in the processor by 
each alliance, both alliances earn a Coopertition Point (which influences their rank in the tournament) and 
lowers the requirements for a ranking point. 
As time runs out, robots prepare to return to the surface with their algae by grabbing onto their cages and 
parking under the barge. 
The alliance that earns the most points wins the match!

5 ARENA  
The ARENA includes all elements of the game infrastructure that are required to play REEFSCAPESM presented 
by Haas: the FIELD, SCORING ELEMENTS, queue area, team media area, designated TECHNICIAN area, and all 
equipment needed for FIELD control, ROBOT control, and scorekeeping. 
Figure 5-1 REEFSCAPE ARENA (queue area, TECHNICIAN area, and media area not pictured) 
 
The ARENA is modular and assembled, used, disassembled, and shipped many times during the competition 
season. It undergoes wear and tear. The ARENA is designed to withstand rigorous play and frequent shipping. 
Every effort is made to ensure that ARENAS are consistent from event to event. However, ARENAS are 
assembled in different venues by different event staff and some small variations occur. For details regarding 
assembly tolerances, please refer to the 2025 ARENA Layout and Marking Diagram. Successful teams will 
design ROBOTS that are insensitive to these variations. 
Illustrations included in this section are for a general visual understanding of the REEFSCAPE ARENA, and 
dimensions included in the manual are nominal. Please refer to the official drawings for exact dimensions, 
tolerances, and construction details. The official drawings, CAD models, and drawings for low-cost versions of 
important elements of the REEFSCAPE FIELD are posted on the REEFSCAPE Playing FIELD web page on the 
FIRST website. 
5.1 FIELD 
Each FIELD for REEFSCAPE is an approximately 26 ft. 5 in. (~805 cm) by 57 ft. 6⅞ in. (~1 755 cm) carpeted 
area bounded by inward facing surfaces of the ALLIANCE WALLS, CORAL STATIONS, PROCESSORS and 
PROCESSOR openings, and guardrails. 

 
Section 5 ARENA

Figure 5-2 FIELD boundary in pink 
 
The FIELD is populated with and surrounded by the following elements:  
− 
1 REEF per ALLIANCE,  
− 
1 PROCESSOR per ALLIANCE,  
− 
2 CORAL STATIONS per ALLIANCE, and  
− 
1 BARGE which consists of 3 CAGES and 1 NET for each ALLIANCE. 
The surface of the FIELD is low pile carpet, Shaw Floors, Philadelphia Commercial, Neyland II 20, “66561 
Medallion.” Neyland II carpet is not available for purchase, and the closest equivalent is Shaw, Philadelphia 
Brand, Profusion 20, Style 54933; see results from FIRST’s evaluation in this blog post.  
Carpet edges and seams are secured with 3MTM Premium Matte Cloth (Gaffers) Tape GT2, GT3 or comparable 
Gaffer’s Tape. Tears, rips, and damage to the carpet may be repaired with the same styles of tape and ROBOTS 
must be prepared to operate on surfaces made of carpet, tape, or combinations of both materials as repairs 
are made through the course of competition. 
Guardrails form the long edges of the FIELD. Guardrails are a 1 ft. 8 in. (~51 cm) tall system of transparent 
polycarbonate supported on the top and bottom by aluminum extrusion. There are 4 gates in the guardrail that 
allow access to the FIELD for placement and removal of ROBOTS. The gate passthrough, when open, is 3 ft. 2 
in. (~97 cm) wide. Gates are closed and shielded during the MATCH.  

 
Section 5 ARENA

Figure 5-3 Gate locations 
 
There are 2 versions of guardrails and DRIVER STATIONS used for competitions. 1 design is reflected in the 
2025 Official FIRST FIELD Drawings & Models. The other is designed and sold by AndyMark. While the designs 
are slightly different, the critical dimensions, performance, and expected user experience between them are the 
same unless otherwise noted. Detailed drawings for the AndyMark design are posted on the AndyMark 
website. All illustrations in this manual show the traditional FIELD design. 
5.2 Areas, Zones, & Markings  
FIELD areas, zones, and markings of consequence are described below. Unless otherwise specified, the tape 
used to mark lines and zones throughout the FIELD is 2 in. (~51 mm) 3M™ Premium Matte Cloth (Gaffers) 
Tape (GT2), ProGaff® Premium Professional Grade Gaffer Tape, or comparable gaffers tape.

5.3 REEF 
Figure 5-5 REEF 
 
A REEF is 1 of 2 5 ft. 5 ½ in. (~166 cm) hexagonal structures with BRANCHES that extend from each side 
where CORAL are scored. Each ALLIANCE has a dedicated REEF centered between each guardrail and located 
12 ft. away from the ALLIANCE WALL. Each REEF has 4 levels to score on: Level 1 (L1), Level 2 (L2), Level 3 
(L3), and Level 4 (L4). 
Figure 5-6: Scoring Level Locations (L1-L4) 
 
The base of each REEF has a trough (L1) into which ROBOTS can score CORAL. The trough includes the 
angled and vertical surfaces, as well as the top of the front edge as shown in Figure 5-7. The front edge of the 
trough is 1 ft. 6 in. (~46 cm) off the carpet.

5.4 BARGE 
Figure 5-9 BARGE 
 
The BARGE is a 29 ft. 2 in. (889 cm) wide, 3 ft. 8 in. (~112 cm) deep, and 8 ft. 5 in. (~257 cm) tall structure that 
spans the center of the FIELD. It is made of truss structure supported by legs just outside the guardrail. The 
BARGE includes 6 CAGES, a red and blue NET, and all structure supporting CAGES and NETS. The horizontal 
truss structure is 5 ft. 2 in. (~157 cm) above the carpet and is supported in the center of the FIELD by vertical 
truss and supporting materials. The BARGE has three CAGE locations on each side located 3 ft. 5½ in., 7 ft. ⅜ 
in., 10 ft. 7⅜ in. (~105 cm, ~214 cm, ~324 cm) from mid field to the center of the CAGE. 
The BARGE has three segments of lights on each side of the truss which indicate progression toward and 
completion of the Coopertition Bonus and the final 20 seconds in the match. One segment will light up each 
time an ALGAE is scored in the PROCESSOR. Once each alliance has scored two ALGAE all six segments will 
illuminate. The lights will flash to indicate that there are 20 seconds left in the match. At the end of the match, 
the lights will illuminate and then turn off 3 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP to 
help indicate to REFEREES when scoring assessments should be made.

5.5 PROCESSOR 
Figure 5-13: PROCESSOR 
 
A PROCESSOR is a goal into which an ALLIANCE scores ALGAE. There is 1 PROCESSOR per ALLIANCE. The 
PROCESSOR is integrated into the guardrail near the ALLIANCE’S REEF ZONE and adjacent to the opponent’s 
PROCESSOR AREA. Each PROCESSOR has a rectangular opening through which ROBOTS score ALGAE which 
is 2 ft. 4 in. wide (~71 cm), 1 ft. 8 in. tall (~51 cm), and 7 in. (~18 cm) from the carpet.  
Once an ALGAE passes through the PROCESSOR, it rolls past a scoring sensor array and into the opponent’s 
PROCESSOR AREA. The HUMAN PLAYER must keep the PROCESSOR clear for scoring, and can shift scored 
ALGAE on top of the PROCESSOR where there are designated ALGAE holders.

The ALLIANCE WALL separates ROBOTS from DRIVE TEAM members in the ALLIANCE AREA. It consists of 3 
DRIVER STATIONS. 
5.6.1 DRIVER STATIONS 
Figure 5-15 DRIVER STATION (ALLIANCE AREA perspective and FIELD perspective) 
 
A DRIVER STATION is 1 of 3 assemblies within an ALLIANCE WALL behind which a DRIVE TEAM operates their 
ROBOT. Each DRIVER STATION is made from a 3 ft. ¾ in. (~93 cm) tall diamond plate base topped with a 3 ft. 
6 in. (~107 cm) tall transparent plastic sheet and a top rail. An aluminum shelf is attached to each DRIVER 

 
Section 5 ARENA 
V4 
30 of 164 
STATION to support an OPERATOR CONSOLE. The shelf is 5 ft. 9 in. (~175 cm) wide and 1 ft. ¼ in. (~31 cm) 
deep. There is a 4 ft. 6 in. (~137 cm) long by 2 in. (nominal) wide strip of hook-and-loop tape (“loop” side) 
along the center of the support shelf that may be used to secure the OPERATOR CONSOLE to the shelf. The 
shelf also includes two clips to hold the shelf in place with a 1 in. (~25 mm) by 2 in. (~51 mm) thick tab that 
sits on the top surface of the shelf. 
There may be a ramp available at events for DRIVE TEAMS with limited mobility. 
It is designed to allow an individual using a wheelchair to access the DRIVER 
STATION shelf and/or see onto the FIELD; however, this accommodation is 
available to anyone who has a wheelchair or other physical disability that 
obstructs their view of the FIELD. Due to space constraints, the ramp is not 
allowed to be used in the PROCESSOR AREA. Teams should speak to the FTA 
before MATCHES begin to ensure that it is available for each of the team’s 
MATCHES.  
This ramp is available at many Regional and District events. For questions, 
please connect with the local Program Delivery Partner. 
Each DRIVER STATION contains the following elements for DRIVE TEAMS: 
− 
1 Ethernet cable: attaches to the Ethernet port of the OPERATOR CONSOLE and provides connectivity 
to the FIELD Management System (FMS) 
− 
1 120VAC NEMA 5-15R power outlet (i.e. standard US outlet): located on each DRIVER STATION shelf 
and protected by its own 2-Amp circuit breaker. It can be used to power the OPERATOR CONSOLE. 
DRIVE TEAMS are responsible for monitoring their power consumption as a tripped breaker in the 
outlet does not constitute an ARENA FAULT. For some events in regions that don’t use NEMA 5-15 
shaped outlets, event organizers may install appropriate plug adapters to be used throughout the event.  
− 
1 Emergency Stop (E-Stop) button: located on the left side of the DRIVER STATION shelf and is used to 
deactivate a ROBOT in an emergency  
− 
1 Autonomous Stop (A-Stop) button: located on the right side of the DRIVER STATION shelf and is used 
to DISABLE a ROBOT during AUTO 
− 
1 team sign: located at the top of each DRIVER STATION. The FIELD facing side of the sign displays the 
team number in the ALLIANCE color. The ALLIANCE AREA side of the sign displays the following 
information in red:   
o Pre-MATCH: team number and ROBOT connection state 
o During the MATCH:  
 
remaining MATCH period time,  
 
MATCH scores, and 
 
progress towards the CORAL RP threshold (n/a during the Playoff Tournament). 
Figure 5-16 Back of team sign 
 

 
Section 5 ARENA

− 
1 timer (in DRIVER STATION 2 only): displays the official time remaining in the MATCH period on the 
FIELD-facing side (in white) and a more detailed breakdown of CORAL scored on each level of the REEF 
on the TEAM-facing side. (in red). 
Figure 5-17 Back of timer 
 
− 
1 team LED stack: indicates ALLIANCE color, ROBOT status, E-Stop and A-Stop status, and is centered 
at the top of each DRIVER STATION.  
The stack includes 2 identical ALLIANCE-colored ROBOT status LEDs above a third amber A-stop/E-
stop LED. LED states are as follows:  
o ROBOT status LEDs 
 
Solid: indicates that the ROBOT is connected and enabled. This only happens during a 
MATCH. 
 
Blinking: indicates that either the FMS is preset for the MATCH and the ROBOT is not 
connected yet, or it’s during a MATCH and the corresponding ROBOT is BYPASSED, has 
lost connectivity, or the E-stop was pressed. 
 
Off: indicates that the ROBOT is linked and DISABLED prior to the start of the MATCH. 
This light is also off, regardless of ROBOT connection status, after the MATCH has 
concluded.  
o A-Stop/E-stop LED  
 
Solid: the ROBOT is DISABLED due to a press of the team E-stop button, the FIELD E-stop 
button, or by the scorekeeper via the FMS.  
 
Blinking: the ROBOT is DISABLED for the remainder of AUTO due to a press of the team 
A-Stop button. 
 
Off: the ROBOT is not DISABLED by the FIELD.  
− 
FMS hardware and wiring: mostly located below shelves in the 2 DRIVER STATIONS closer to the 
scoring table.

5.6.2 CORAL STATION 
Figure 5-18 CORAL STATION 
 
A CORAL STATION is an assembly through which HUMAN PLAYERS feed CORAL into the FIELD. There are 4 
CORAL STATIONS, 1 in each corner of the FIELD connecting the guardrail to the ALLIANCE WALL. Each CORAL 
STATION has a 6 ft. 4 in. wide by 7 in. tall (~193 cm wide by ~18 cm tall) opening through which CORAL 
passes to the FIELD; the bottom of the opening is 3 ft. 1½ in. (~95 cm) from the carpet. A 55° sloped tunnel, 
called the CHUTE, leads to the opening in the CORAL STATION.  
There are 2 stools available at events for DRIVE TEAMS to use. Each stool is 1 ft. 
11 in. (~58 cm) wide by 1 ft. 1½ in. (~34 cm) deep, 6¼ in. (~16 cm) tall, and rated 
for 300 lbs. (~136 kg). 
It is specially intended to allow individuals who are shorter, better sightlines onto 
the FIELD; however, this accommodation is available to anyone who has another 
physical disability that obstructs their view of the FIELD. Due to space 
constraints, stools are not allowed to be used in the PROCESSOR AREA. 
Only 2 stools are available, and priority will be given to those with the biggest 
need. Teams should speak to the FTA before MATCHES begin to request that it 
is available for each of the team’s MATCHES. Teams may also purchase their 
own (Item Number: 779ac01stpm) or bring an equivalent (e.g. not foldable and 
similar dimensions) version to the event to guarantee use for every match.  
This stool is available at all events within the US & Canada and equivalents are 
available at international events. For questions, please connect with the local 
Program Delivery Partner. 
5.7 SCORING ELEMENTS 
SCORING ELEMENTS are items that teams use to score additional points. There are 2 types of SCORING 
ELEMENTS used in REEFSCAPE: CORAL and ALGAE.  

 
Section 5 ARENA 
V4 
33 of 164 
5.7.1 CORAL 
Figure 5-19 CORAL 
 
A CORAL is a 11 ⅞ in. long (~30 cm) piece of 4 in. diameter Schedule 40 Cellular (Foam) Core PVC pipe. 
CORAL has a 4-in. (~102 mm) inside diameter and a 4½-in. (~11 cm) outside diameter. CORAL is available for 
purchase from AndyMark, am-5601 or can be cut from longer lengths of 4 in. diameter Schedule 40 Cellular 
(Foam) Core PVC pipe.  
Prior to Kickoff, CORAL was known as “Game Piece 1” and not available for pre-
order prior to the season. 
CORAL in the KOP and at events has a weight of between 1.1-1.8 lbs. (~0.5-0.8 kg) and has text marking along 
the length of the pipe that may vary in color.  
Teams should be aware that CORAL and PVC pipe from different sources may 
have variances in color, markings, and weight.  
CORAL undergoes wear and tear during a competition. Generally, a CORAL that still appears to look 
approximately like a CORAL is considered a CORAL for the purposes of rule evaluation and scoring, whether 
damaged or not. Small chunks of a CORAL are not considered a CORAL. 
The edge of the CORAL may be rough or sharp. Teams should use caution when 
handling CORAL. 

 
Section 5 ARENA

5.7.2 ALGAE 
Figure 5-20: ALGAE 
 
Each ALGAE is a 16.25 in. (~413 mm) ± ¼ in. (~6 mm) diameter rubber playground ball. The ball is custom 
made for FIRST by Baden Sports and sold by AndyMark am-5602. 
Prior to Kickoff, ALGAE was known as “Game Piece 2” and was available for pre-
order prior to the season.  
At events, ALGAE will be inflated using a sizing gauge so that the diameter measures between 16 in. (~406 
mm) and 16.5 in. (~419 mm). The ALGAE and the jig will both be placed on a flat surface, and the ALGAE will 
be inflated with the valve sticking up vertically so that the seam is perpendicular to the large hole in the jig. It 
will be inflated until the two opposite points along the seam are contacting the top edge of the hole in the jig, 
which is 16.25 in. (~413 mm) diameter. 
The tolerances to which ALGAE are manufactured allow for variances in 
diameter, wall thickness, weight distribution and overall weight. They may not 
always be uniformly spherical, roll straight, or bounce as expected.

5.9 The FIELD Management System 
The FIELD Management System (FMS) is all the electronics responsible for sensing and controlling the FIRST 
Robotics Competition FIELD. The FMS encompasses all FIELD electronics, including computers, REFEREE 
touchscreens, the wireless access point, sensors, stack lights, A-Stops and E-Stops, etc.  
When a DRIVE TEAM connects the Ethernet cable from their assigned DRIVER STATION to their OPERATOR 
CONSOLE, the Driver Station Software on the OPERATOR CONSOLE computer communicates with FMS. Once 
connected, the open ports available are described in Table 8-5. 
Note that ROBOT code cannot be deployed while connected to the FMS. Additional information about the FMS 
may be found in the FMS Whitepaper. 
The FMS alerts participants to milestones in the MATCH using audio cues detailed in Table 5-1. Please note 
that audio cues are intended as a courtesy to participants and not intended as official MATCH markers. If 
there is a discrepancy between an audio cue and the FIELD timers, the FIELD timers are the authority.

5.10 FIELD STAFF 
FIELD STAFF are responsible for making sure the MATCHES are cycled through efficiently, fairly, safely, and 
with a spirit of cooperation, Gracious Professionalism, and generosity of spirit. FIELD STAFF roles are filled by 
volunteers from the community who prepare for the event with thorough training and certification. There are 3 
FIELD-side key volunteer roles with whom teams should be familiar and are encouraged to use as resources to 
make their event experience valuable (in whatever way the team defines “valuable”). 
− 
Head REFEREE – trains, directs, and supervises REFEREES. They oversee all scoring processes and 
procedures in collaboration with the FIRST Technical Advisor (FTA). They interact with STUDENTS,

5 ARENA  
The ARENA includes all elements of the game infrastructure that are required to play REEFSCAPESM presented 
by Haas: the FIELD, SCORING ELEMENTS, queue area, team media area, designated TECHNICIAN area, and all 
equipment needed for FIELD control, ROBOT control, and scorekeeping. 
Figure 5-1 REEFSCAPE ARENA (queue area, TECHNICIAN area, and media area not pictured) 
 
The ARENA is modular and assembled, used, disassembled, and shipped many times during the competition 
season. It undergoes wear and tear. The ARENA is designed to withstand rigorous play and frequent shipping. 
Every effort is made to ensure that ARENAS are consistent from event to event. However, ARENAS are 
assembled in different venues by different event staff and some small variations occur. For details regarding 
assembly tolerances, please refer to the 2025 ARENA Layout and Marking Diagram. Successful teams will 
design ROBOTS that are insensitive to these variations. 
Illustrations included in this section are for a general visual understanding of the REEFSCAPE ARENA, and 
dimensions included in the manual are nominal. Please refer to the official drawings for exact dimensions, 
tolerances, and construction details. The official drawings, CAD models, and drawings for low-cost versions of 
important elements of the REEFSCAPE FIELD are posted on the REEFSCAPE Playing FIELD web page on the 
FIRST website. 
5.1 FIELD 
Each FIELD for REEFSCAPE is an approximately 26 ft. 5 in. (~805 cm) by 57 ft. 6⅞ in. (~1 755 cm) carpeted 
area bounded by inward facing surfaces of the ALLIANCE WALLS, CORAL STATIONS, PROCESSORS and 
PROCESSOR openings, and guardrails. 

 
Section 5 ARENA

Figure 5-2 FIELD boundary in pink 
 
The FIELD is populated with and surrounded by the following elements:  
− 
1 REEF per ALLIANCE,  
− 
1 PROCESSOR per ALLIANCE,  
− 
2 CORAL STATIONS per ALLIANCE, and  
− 
1 BARGE which consists of 3 CAGES and 1 NET for each ALLIANCE. 
The surface of the FIELD is low pile carpet, Shaw Floors, Philadelphia Commercial, Neyland II 20, “66561 
Medallion.” Neyland II carpet is not available for purchase, and the closest equivalent is Shaw, Philadelphia 
Brand, Profusion 20, Style 54933; see results from FIRST’s evaluation in this blog post.  
Carpet edges and seams are secured with 3MTM Premium Matte Cloth (Gaffers) Tape GT2, GT3 or comparable 
Gaffer’s Tape. Tears, rips, and damage to the carpet may be repaired with the same styles of tape and ROBOTS 
must be prepared to operate on surfaces made of carpet, tape, or combinations of both materials as repairs 
are made through the course of competition. 
Guardrails form the long edges of the FIELD. Guardrails are a 1 ft. 8 in. (~51 cm) tall system of transparent 
polycarbonate supported on the top and bottom by aluminum extrusion. There are 4 gates in the guardrail that 
allow access to the FIELD for placement and removal of ROBOTS. The gate passthrough, when open, is 3 ft. 2 
in. (~97 cm) wide. Gates are closed and shielded during the MATCH.

The BARGE is a 29 ft. 2 in. (889 cm) wide, 3 ft. 8 in. (~112 cm) deep, and 8 ft. 5 in. (~257 cm) tall structure that 
spans the center of the FIELD. It is made of truss structure supported by legs just outside the guardrail. The 
BARGE includes 6 CAGES, a red and blue NET, and all structure supporting CAGES and NETS. The horizontal 
truss structure is 5 ft. 2 in. (~157 cm) above the carpet and is supported in the center of the FIELD by vertical 
truss and supporting materials. The BARGE has three CAGE locations on each side located 3 ft. 5½ in., 7 ft. ⅜ 
in., 10 ft. 7⅜ in. (~105 cm, ~214 cm, ~324 cm) from mid field to the center of the CAGE. 
The BARGE has three segments of lights on each side of the truss which indicate progression toward and 
completion of the Coopertition Bonus and the final 20 seconds in the match. One segment will light up each 
time an ALGAE is scored in the PROCESSOR. Once each alliance has scored two ALGAE all six segments will 
illuminate. The lights will flash to indicate that there are 20 seconds left in the match. At the end of the match, 
the lights will illuminate and then turn off 3 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP to 
help indicate to REFEREES when scoring assessments should be made.

Figure 5-18 CORAL STATION 
 
A CORAL STATION is an assembly through which HUMAN PLAYERS feed CORAL into the FIELD. There are 4 
CORAL STATIONS, 1 in each corner of the FIELD connecting the guardrail to the ALLIANCE WALL. Each CORAL 
STATION has a 6 ft. 4 in. wide by 7 in. tall (~193 cm wide by ~18 cm tall) opening through which CORAL 
passes to the FIELD; the bottom of the opening is 3 ft. 1½ in. (~95 cm) from the carpet. A 55° sloped tunnel, 
called the CHUTE, leads to the opening in the CORAL STATION.  
There are 2 stools available at events for DRIVE TEAMS to use. Each stool is 1 ft. 
11 in. (~58 cm) wide by 1 ft. 1½ in. (~34 cm) deep, 6¼ in. (~16 cm) tall, and rated 
for 300 lbs. (~136 kg). 
It is specially intended to allow individuals who are shorter, better sightlines onto 
the FIELD; however, this accommodation is available to anyone who has another

constraints, stools are not allowed to be used in the PROCESSOR AREA. 
Only 2 stools are available, and priority will be given to those with the biggest 
need. Teams should speak to the FTA before MATCHES begin to request that it 
is available for each of the team’s MATCHES. Teams may also purchase their 
own (Item Number: 779ac01stpm) or bring an equivalent (e.g. not foldable and 
similar dimensions) version to the event to guarantee use for every match.  
This stool is available at all events within the US & Canada and equivalents are 
available at international events. For questions, please connect with the local

Figure 5-18 CORAL STATION 
 
A CORAL STATION is an assembly through which HUMAN PLAYERS feed CORAL into the FIELD. There are 4 
CORAL STATIONS, 1 in each corner of the FIELD connecting the guardrail to the ALLIANCE WALL. Each CORAL 
STATION has a 6 ft. 4 in. wide by 7 in. tall (~193 cm wide by ~18 cm tall) opening through which CORAL 
passes to the FIELD; the bottom of the opening is 3 ft. 1½ in. (~95 cm) from the carpet. A 55° sloped tunnel, 
called the CHUTE, leads to the opening in the CORAL STATION.  
There are 2 stools available at events for DRIVE TEAMS to use. Each stool is 1 ft. 
11 in. (~58 cm) wide by 1 ft. 1½ in. (~34 cm) deep, 6¼ in. (~16 cm) tall, and rated 
for 300 lbs. (~136 kg). 
It is specially intended to allow individuals who are shorter, better sightlines onto 
the FIELD; however, this accommodation is available to anyone who has another 
physical disability that obstructs their view of the FIELD. Due to space 
constraints, stools are not allowed to be used in the PROCESSOR AREA. 
Only 2 stools are available, and priority will be given to those with the biggest

A CORAL is a 11 ⅞ in. long (~30 cm) piece of 4 in. diameter Schedule 40 Cellular (Foam) Core PVC pipe. 
CORAL has a 4-in. (~102 mm) inside diameter and a 4½-in. (~11 cm) outside diameter. CORAL is available for 
purchase from AndyMark, am-5601 or can be cut from longer lengths of 4 in. diameter Schedule 40 Cellular 
(Foam) Core PVC pipe.  
Prior to Kickoff, CORAL was known as “Game Piece 1” and not available for pre-
order prior to the season. 
CORAL in the KOP and at events has a weight of between 1.1-1.8 lbs. (~0.5-0.8 kg) and has text marking along 
the length of the pipe that may vary in color.  
Teams should be aware that CORAL and PVC pipe from different sources may 
have variances in color, markings, and weight.  
CORAL undergoes wear and tear during a competition. Generally, a CORAL that still appears to look 
approximately like a CORAL is considered a CORAL for the purposes of rule evaluation and scoring, whether 
damaged or not. Small chunks of a CORAL are not considered a CORAL. 
The edge of the CORAL may be rough or sharp. Teams should use caution when 
handling CORAL.

Each ALGAE is a 16.25 in. (~413 mm) ± ¼ in. (~6 mm) diameter rubber playground ball. The ball is custom 
made for FIRST by Baden Sports and sold by AndyMark am-5602. 
Prior to Kickoff, ALGAE was known as “Game Piece 2” and was available for pre-
order prior to the season.  
At events, ALGAE will be inflated using a sizing gauge so that the diameter measures between 16 in. (~406 
mm) and 16.5 in. (~419 mm). The ALGAE and the jig will both be placed on a flat surface, and the ALGAE will 
be inflated with the valve sticking up vertically so that the seam is perpendicular to the large hole in the jig. It 
will be inflated until the two opposite points along the seam are contacting the top edge of the hole in the jig, 
which is 16.25 in. (~413 mm) diameter. 
The tolerances to which ALGAE are manufactured allow for variances in 
diameter, wall thickness, weight distribution and overall weight. They may not 
always be uniformly spherical, roll straight, or bounce as expected.

6 Game Details 
Figure 6-1 REEFSCAPE 
 
In REEFSCAPE, 2 ALLIANCES (an ALLIANCE is a cooperative of up to 4 FIRST Robotics Competition teams) 
play MATCHES, set up and implemented per the details described below.  
6.1 MATCH Overview 
MATCHES run on 7–10-minute cycles, which consist of pre-MATCH setup, the 2-minute and 30-second 
MATCH, and the post-MATCH reset. 
During the MATCH, ROBOTS collect CORAL and score on their REEF. ROBOTS also collect ALGAE and score in 
their PROCESSOR or NET. HUMAN PLAYERS can score ALGAE in their NET once it has been passed to them 
via their opponent’s PROCESSOR.  
ROBOTS conclude the MATCH PARKING in their BARGE ZONE or suspending from a CAGE. 
6.2 DRIVE TEAM 
A DRIVE TEAM is a set of up to 5 people from the same FIRST Robotics Competition team responsible for 
team performance for a specific MATCH. There are 4 specific roles on a DRIVE TEAM which ALLIANCES can 
use to assist ROBOTS with REEFSCAPE, and no more than 1 member of the DRIVE TEAM may be a non-
STUDENT.  
The intent of the definition of DRIVE TEAM and DRIVE TEAM related rules is that, 
barring extenuating circumstances, the DRIVE TEAM consists of people who 
arrived at the event affiliated with that team and are responsible for their team’s 
and ROBOT’S performance at the event (this means a person may be affiliated

6.3.5 CAGES 
Each team can choose the height of the CAGE closest to their driver station. By default, all CAGES are left in 
the state from the last match. At the start of each day, all CAGES are set as deep CAGES. If a team would like 
to alter the CAGE height they must alert the FIELD STAFF during reset. Each team informs FIELD STAFF of their 
preference for their corresponding CAGE height.

6.4 MATCH Phases 
The first phase of each MATCH is 15 seconds long and called the Autonomous Period (AUTO). During AUTO, 
ROBOTS operate without any DRIVE TEAM control or input. ROBOTS attempt to leave their ROBOT STARTING

LINE, score SCORING ELEMENTS, and retrieve SCORING ELEMENTS. There is a 3-second delay between AUTO 
and TELEOP for scoring purposes as described in section 6.5 Scoring. 
The second phase of each MATCH is the remaining 2 minutes and 15 seconds (2:15) and called the 
Teleoperated Period (TELEOP). During TELEOP, DRIVERS remotely operate ROBOTS to retrieve and score 
SCORING ELEMENTS and climb their CAGES. 
6.5 Scoring  
ALLIANCES are rewarded for accomplishing various actions throughout a MATCH, including LEAVING their 
ROBOT STARTING LINE, scoring CORAL on their REEF, scoring ALGAE in their PROCESSOR and NET, climbing 
CAGES, and winning or tying MATCHES. 
Rewards are granted either via MATCH points, Coopertition points, or Ranking Points (often abbreviated to RP, 
which increase the measure used to rank teams in the Qualification Tournament).  
All scores are assessed and updated throughout the MATCH, except as follows:  
A. assessment of CORAL scored on the REEF and ALGAE scored in the PROCESSOR or NET continues for 
up to 3 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following AUTO. 
B. assessment of CORAL scored on the REEF and ALGAE scored in the PROCESSOR or NET continues for 
up to 3 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP. 
C. assessment of CAGE points is made 3 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP, 
or when all ROBOTS have come to rest following the conclusion of the MATCH, whichever happens 
first. 
LEAVING the ROBOT STARTING LINE, CORAL scoring, ALGAE scoring in the NET, 
PARKING and CAGE points are all evaluated and scored by human volunteers. 
Teams are encouraged to make sure that it is obvious and unambiguous that the 
criteria are met. 
6.5.1 SCORING ELEMENT Scoring Criteria 
A CORAL is scored in the trough (L1) of the REEF if it is not in contact with a ROBOT on that ALLIANCE, not 
scored on any other level of the REEF, and 
A. contacting the trough, or 
B. directly supported (either fully or partially) by a CORAL in contact with the trough.  
 

 
Section 6 Game Details 
V13

Figure 6-5 Examples of CORAL scored in the trough (L1) 
 
Figure 6-5 includes examples of CORAL on the REEF at the conclusion of a 
MATCH.  
A. CORAL A, C, F, and H are scored because they meet criteria A. 
B. CORAL B and G are scored because they meet criteria B. 
C. CORAL D and E do not meet any criteria for trough scoring. 
 
A CORAL is scored on L2-L4 BRANCH if the BRANCH is inside the volume of the CORAL and the CORAL is not 
in contact with a ROBOT on that ALLIANCE or an ALGAE. Only 1 CORAL can be scored per BRANCH. 
An ALGAE is scored in a PROCESSOR once it has passed through the opening of the PROCESSOR and by the 
sensor array. An ALGAE is scored in a NET if it is above the NET and within the perimeter of the NET, 
contacting the NET or ALGAE contacting the NET, and not in contact with a ROBOT on that ALLIANCE. 
If a CORAL scored in AUTO gets removed from a BRANCH during TELEOP, the AUTO points are removed but 
the CORAL will still count towards the AUTO RP. If a CORAL is scored in that location again, the AUTO points 
associated with the original scored CORAL is restored. CORAL scored in the trough is not tracked by specific 
location, if a CORAL is removed from the trough after AUTO, the points removed will correspond to the lowest 
scoring CORAL (i.e. TELEOP CORAL removed first); if CORAL is re-scored in the trough, points will be re-added 
in the reverse order (i.e. AUTO CORAL re-added first). 
6.5.2 ROBOT Scoring Criteria 
To qualify for LEAVE points, a ROBOT must move such that its BUMPERS no longer overlap its ROBOT 
STARTING LINE at the end of AUTO.  
To qualify for PARK points, a ROBOT’S BUMPERS must be partially or completely contained in their BARGE 
ZONE at the end of the MATCH and does not meet the criteria for CAGE points. 

 
Section 6 Game Details 
V13 
49 of 164 
To qualify for CAGE points, a ROBOT must be contacting one and only one of their ALLIANCE’S CAGES (and 
not touching any ANCHOR), not contacting the carpet, and may additionally contact only the following 
elements: 
A. SCORING ELEMENTS, 
B. another ROBOT qualified for CAGE points,  
C. a partner ROBOT contacted by an opponent in violation of G428, and 
D. an opponent ROBOT. 
6.5.3 Coopertition Bonus 
In Qualification MATCHES, if at least 2 ALGAE are scored in each ALLIANCE’S PROCESSOR, all teams earn 1 
Coopertition Point, and the threshold for the CORAL RP decreases as described in Table 6-2. 
See section 10.5.3 Qualification Ranking for more information about Coopertition influence on Qualification 
Ranking order.

6.6.1 YELLOW and RED CARDS 
In addition to rule violations explicitly listed throughout this document, YELLOW CARDS and RED CARDS are 
used in FIRST Robotics Competition to address team and ROBOT behavior that does not align with the mission, 
values, and culture of FIRST. 
The Head REFEREE may assign a YELLOW CARD as a warning, or a RED CARD for egregious behavior 
inappropriate at a FIRST Robotics Competition event. 
A YELLOW or RED CARD is indicated by the Head REFEREE holding a YELLOW and/or RED CARD in the air 
while the Game Announcer describes the violation. 
YELLOW CARDS are additive, meaning that a second YELLOW CARD is automatically converted to a RED 
CARD. A team is issued a RED CARD for any subsequent incident in which they receive an additional YELLOW 
CARD, including earning a second YELLOW CARD during a single MATCH. A second YELLOW CARD is 
indicated by the Head REFEREE holding a YELLOW CARD and RED CARD in the air simultaneously after the 
completion of the MATCH. A team that has received either a YELLOW CARD or a RED CARD carries a YELLOW 
CARD into subsequent MATCHES, except as noted below.  
Once a team receives a YELLOW or RED CARD, a yellow rectangle will show next to the team number on the 
audience display during subsequent MATCHES, including any replays.

6.6.3 YELLOW and RED CARDS during Playoff MATCHES 
During Playoff MATCHES, YELLOW and RED CARDS are assigned to the violating team’s entire ALLIANCE 
instead of to only the violating team. If an ALLIANCE receives 2 YELLOW CARDS, the entire ALLIANCE is issued 
a RED CARD which results in DISQUALIFICATION for the associated MATCH. If both ALLIANCES receive a RED 
CARD, the ALLIANCE assessed the first RED CARD, chronologically, is DISQUALIFIED and loses the MATCH. 
6.6.4 Violation Details 
There are several styles of violation wording used in this manual. Below are some example violations and a 
clarification of the way the violation would be assessed. The examples shown do not represent all possible 
violations, but rather a representative set of combinations.
