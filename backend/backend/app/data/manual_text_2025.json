(~112 cm) deep, and 8 ft. 5 in. (~257 cm) tall structure that \nspans the center of the FIELD. It is made of truss structure supported by legs just outside the guardrail. The \nBARGE includes 6 CAGES, a red and blue NET, and all structure supporting CAGES and NETS. The horizontal \ntruss structure is 5 ft. 2 in. (~157 cm) above the carpet and is supported in the center of the FIELD by vertical \ntruss and supporting materials. The BARGE has three CAGE locations on each side located 3 ft. 5\u00bd in., 7 ft. \u215c \nin., 10 ft. 7\u215c in. (~105 cm, ~214 cm, ~324 cm) from mid field to the center of the CAGE. \nThe BARGE has three segments of lights on each side of the truss which indicate progression toward and \ncompletion of the Coopertition Bonus and the final 20 seconds in the match. One segment will light up each \ntime an ALGAE is scored in the PROCESSOR. Once each alliance has scored two ALGAE all six segments will \nilluminate. The lights will flash to indicate that there are 20 seconds left in the match. At the end of the match, \nthe lights will illuminate and then turn off 3 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP to \nhelp indicate to REFEREES when scoring assessments should be made. \n\n \nSection 5 ARENA \nV4 \n26 of 164 \n5.4.1 CAGE \nFigure 5-10 Shallow (left) and Deep (right) staged CAGES \n \nCAGES are 2 ft. tall and 7\u215c in. wide (outside dimension) (~61 cm tall and ~19 cm wide) rectangular structures. \nEach CAGE is a welded structure made of 4 steel 1 in. Schedule 40 pipes, a bottom plate, a top plate, and an \neyebolt with fastening hardware. CAGES are suspended from the truss structure in specific locations as shown \nin Figure 5-9 and hang at shallow or deep positions according to the corresponding team\u2019s selection (see \nsection 6.3.5 CAGES for details) such that the bottom of the cage is 2 ft. 6-1/8 in. (~77 cm) and 3-1/8 in. (~79 \nmm) from the carpet respectively. Deep CAGES are suspended using chain that is 19 links of \u00bc-in. Grade 43 \nzinc plated chain. \nANCHORS are a collection of surfaces at the top of the CAGE and chain assembly that include the following \nitems and as shown in Figure 5-11: \nA. the top surface of the CAGE top plate, \nB. the chain, \nC. both carabiners, \nD. the portion of the eye bolt extending above the CAGE top plate, \nE. the eye nut attached to the BARGE, \nF. the upper end surfaces of the CAGE pipes, and \nG. the inside surfaces of the CAGE pipes. \n \n\n \nSection 5 ARENA \nV4 \n27 of 164 \nFigure 5-11: ANCHOR Surfaces \n \n5.4.2 NET \nFigure 5-12 NET \n \nA NET is a goal in which an ALLIANCE scores ALGAE. The NET is \u00bc in. (~6 mm) knit polyester mesh, 4 ft. \n(~122 cm) wide by 12 ft. (~366 cm) long with a sewn cord border. It is available for purchase from AndyMark, \nam-5522. It is suspended from the top of the BARGE such that its lowest point hangs 6 ft. 4 in. (~193 cm) \nabove the FIELD carpet. There is a NET for the Blue ALLIANCE and for the Red ALLIANCE.  \n\n\n\n--- Section: 5.4.1 CAGE (Page 26) ---\n \nSection 5 ARENA \nV4 \n26 of 164 \n5.4.1 CAGE \nFigure 5-10 Shallow (left) and Deep (right) staged CAGES \n \nCAGES are 2 ft. tall and 7\u215c in. wide (outside dimension) (~61 cm tall and ~19 cm wide) rectangular structures. \nEach CAGE is a welded structure made of 4 steel 1 in.

It is suspended from the top of the BARGE such that its lowest point hangs 6 ft. 4 in. (~193 cm) \nabove the FIELD carpet. There is a NET for the Blue ALLIANCE and for the Red ALLIANCE.  \n\n\n\n--- Section: 5.3 REEF (Page 23) ---\n \nSection 5 ARENA \nV4 \n23 of 164 \n5.3 REEF \nFigure 5-5 REEF \n \nA REEF is 1 of 2 5 ft. 5 \u00bd in. (~166 cm) hexagonal structures with BRANCHES that extend from each side \nwhere CORAL are scored. Each ALLIANCE has a dedicated REEF centered between each guardrail and located \n12 ft. away from the ALLIANCE WALL. Each REEF has 4 levels to score on: Level 1 (L1), Level 2 (L2), Level 3 \n(L3), and Level 4 (L4). \nFigure 5-6: Scoring Level Locations (L1-L4) \n \nThe base of each REEF has a trough (L1) into which ROBOTS can score CORAL. The trough includes the \nangled and vertical surfaces, as well as the top of the front edge as shown in Figure 5-7. The front edge of the \ntrough is 1 ft. 6 in. (~46 cm) off the carpet. \n\n \nSection 5 ARENA \nV4 \n24 of 164 \nFigure 5-7: Trough Surfaces \n \nVertical pipes extend up from the base, and pipes on the same face are 1 ft. 1 in. (~33 cm) apart (center to \ncenter). The pipes are made out of 1-\u00bc in. Schedule 40 Steel. Each pipe has 3 BRANCHES which are angled or \ncompound extensions from the REEF vertical pipes. \nL2 is the 12 lowest level BRANCHES and are angled up at 35\u00b0. The highest point of the L2 BRANCH is 2 ft. 7\u215e \nin. (~81 cm) from the carpet and is inset 1\u215d in. (~41 mm) from the REEF base. \nL3 is the 12 mid-level BRANCHES and are angled up at 35\u00b0. The highest point of the L3 BRANCH is 3 ft. 11\u215d in. \n(~121 cm) from the carpet and is inset 1\u215d in. (~41 mm) from the REEF base. \nL4 is the 12 highest-level BRANCHES and they are vertical. The highest point of the L4 BRANCH is 6 ft. (~183 \ncm) from the carpet and is inset 1\u215b in. (~29 mm) from the REEF base.   \nFor scoring purposes, the BRANCHES of the REEF are tracked in FMS as follows: \nFigure 5-8: Reef Scoring Location Tracking \n \n\n\n\n--- Section: 5.5 PROCESSOR (Page 28) ---\n \nSection 5 ARENA \nV4 \n28 of 164 \n5.5 PROCESSOR \nFigure 5-13: PROCESSOR \n \nA PROCESSOR is a goal into which an ALLIANCE scores ALGAE. There is 1 PROCESSOR per ALLIANCE. The \nPROCESSOR is integrated into the guardrail near the ALLIANCE\u2019S REEF ZONE and adjacent to the opponent\u2019s \nPROCESSOR AREA. Each PROCESSOR has a rectangular opening through which ROBOTS score ALGAE which \nis 2 ft. 4 in. wide (~71 cm), 1 ft. 8 in. tall (~51 cm), and 7 in. (~18 cm) from the carpet.  \nOnce an ALGAE passes through the PROCESSOR, it rolls past a scoring sensor array and into the opponent\u2019s \nPROCESSOR AREA. The HUMAN PLAYER must keep the PROCESSOR clear for scoring, and can shift scored \nALGAE on top of the PROCESSOR where there are designated ALGAE holders. \n\n\n\n--- Section: 5.7 SCORING ELEMENTS (Page 32) ---\n \nSection 5 ARENA \nV4 \n32 of 164 \n5.6.2 CORAL STATION \nFigure 5-18 CORAL STATION \n \nA CORAL STATION is an assembly through which HUMAN PLAYERS feed CORAL into the FIELD. There are 4 \nCORAL STATIONS, 1 in each corner of the FIELD connecting the guardrail to the ALLIANCE WALL. Each CORAL \nSTATION has a 6 ft. 4 in. wide by 7 in. tall (~193 cm wide by ~18 cm tall) opening through which CORAL \npasses to the FIELD; the bottom of the opening is 3 ft. 1\u00bd in. (~95 cm) from the carpet. A 55\u00b0 sloped tunnel, \ncalled the CHUTE, leads to the opening in the CORAL STATION.  \nThere are 2 stools available at events for DRIVE TEAMS to use. Each stool is 1 ft. \n11 in. (~58 cm) wide by 1 ft. 1\u00bd in. (~34 cm) deep, 6\u00bc in. (~16 cm) tall, and rated \nfor 300 lbs. (~136 kg). \nIt is specially intended to allow individuals who are shorter, better sightlines onto \nthe FIELD; however, this accommodation is available to anyone who has another \nphysical disability that obstructs their view of the FIELD. Due to space \nconstraints, stools are not allowed to be used in the PROCESSOR AREA. \nOnly 2 stools are available, and priority will be given to those with the biggest \nneed. Teams should speak to the FTA before MATCHES begin to request that it \nis available for each of the team\u2019s MATCHES. Teams may also purchase their \nown (Item Number: 779ac01stpm) or bring an equivalent (e.g. not foldable and \nsimilar dimensions) version to the event to guarantee use for every match.  \nThis stool is available at all events within the US & Canada and equivalents are \navailable at international events. For questions, please connect with the local \nProgram Delivery Partner. \n5.7 SCORING ELEMENTS \nSCORING ELEMENTS are items that teams use to score additional points. There are 2 types of SCORING \nELEMENTS used in REEFSCAPE: CORAL and ALGAE.  \n\n \nSection 5 ARENA \nV4 \n33 of 164 \n5.7.1 CORAL \nFigure 5-19 CORAL \n \nA CORAL is a 11 \u215e in. long (~30 cm) piece of 4 in. diameter Schedule 40 Cellular (Foam) Core PVC pipe. \nCORAL has a 4-in. (~102 mm) inside diameter and a 4\u00bd-in. (~11 cm) outside diameter. CORAL is available for \npurchase from AndyMark, am-5601 or can be cut from longer lengths of 4 in. diameter Schedule 40 Cellular \n(Foam) Core PVC pipe.  \nPrior to Kickoff, CORAL was known as \u201cGame Piece 1\u201d and not available for pre-\norder prior to the season. \nCORAL in the KOP and at events has a weight of between 1.1-1.8 lbs. (~0.5-0.8 kg) and has text marking along \nthe length of the pipe that may vary in color.  \nTeams should be aware that CORAL and PVC pipe from different sources may \nhave variances in color, markings, and weight.  \nCORAL undergoes wear and tear during a competition. Generally, a CORAL that still appears to look \napproximately like a CORAL is considered a CORAL for the purposes of rule evaluation and scoring, whether \ndamaged or not. Small chunks of a CORAL are not considered a CORAL. \nThe edge of the CORAL may be rough or sharp. Teams should use caution when \nhandling CORAL. \n\n \nSection 5 ARENA \nV4 \n34 of 164 \n5.7.2 ALGAE \nFigure 5-20: ALGAE \n \nEach ALGAE is a 16.25 in. (~413 mm) \u00b1 \u00bc in. (~6 mm) diameter rubber playground ball. The ball is custom \nmade for FIRST by Baden Sports and sold by AndyMark am-5602. \nPrior to Kickoff, ALGAE was known as \u201cGame Piece 2\u201d and was available for pre-\norder prior to the season.  \nAt events, ALGAE will be inflated using a sizing gauge so that the diameter measures between 16 in. (~406 \nmm) and 16.5 in. (~419 mm). The ALGAE and the jig will both be placed on a flat surface, and the ALGAE will \nbe inflated with the valve sticking up vertically so that the seam is perpendicular to the large hole in the jig. It \nwill be inflated until the two opposite points along the seam are contacting the top edge of the hole in the jig, \nwhich is 16.25 in. (~413 mm) diameter. \nThe tolerances to which ALGAE are manufactured allow for variances in \ndiameter, wall thickness, weight distribution and overall weight. They may not \nalways be uniformly spherical, roll straight, or bounce as expected. \n\n\n\n--- Section: 5.7.1 CORAL (Page 33) ---\n \nSection 5 ARENA \nV4 \n33 of 164 \n5.7.1 CORAL \nFigure 5-19 CORAL \n \nA CORAL is a 11 \u215e in. long (~30 cm) piece of 4 in. diameter Schedule 40 Cellular (Foam) Core PVC pipe. \nCORAL has a 4-in.

There is a 3-second delay between AUTO \nand TELEOP for scoring purposes as described in section 6.5 Scoring. \nThe second phase of each MATCH is the remaining 2 minutes and 15 seconds (2:15) and called the \nTeleoperated Period (TELEOP). During TELEOP, DRIVERS remotely operate ROBOTS to retrieve and score \nSCORING ELEMENTS and climb their CAGES. \n6.5 Scoring  \nALLIANCES are rewarded for accomplishing various actions throughout a MATCH, including LEAVING their \nROBOT STARTING LINE, scoring CORAL on their REEF, scoring ALGAE in their PROCESSOR and NET, climbing \nCAGES, and winning or tying MATCHES. \nRewards are granted either via MATCH points, Coopertition points, or Ranking Points (often abbreviated to RP, \nwhich increase the measure used to rank teams in the Qualification Tournament).  \nAll scores are assessed and updated throughout the MATCH, except as follows:  \nA. assessment of CORAL scored on the REEF and ALGAE scored in the PROCESSOR or NET continues for \nup to 3 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following AUTO. \nB. assessment of CORAL scored on the REEF and ALGAE scored in the PROCESSOR or NET continues for \nup to 3 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP. \nC. assessment of CAGE points is made 3 seconds after the ARENA timer displays 0:00 following TELEOP, \nor when all ROBOTS have come to rest following the conclusion of the MATCH, whichever happens \nfirst. \nLEAVING the ROBOT STARTING LINE, CORAL scoring, ALGAE scoring in the NET, \nPARKING and CAGE points are all evaluated and scored by human volunteers. \nTeams are encouraged to make sure that it is obvious and unambiguous that the \ncriteria are met. \n6.5.1 SCORING ELEMENT Scoring Criteria \nA CORAL is scored in the trough (L1) of the REEF if it is not in contact with a ROBOT on that ALLIANCE, not \nscored on any other level of the REEF, and \nA. contacting the trough, or \nB. directly supported (either fully or partially) by a CORAL in contact with the trough.  \n \n\n \nSection 6 Game Details \nV13 \n48 of 164 \nFigure 6-5 Examples of CORAL scored in the trough (L1) \n \nFigure 6-5 includes examples of CORAL on the REEF at the conclusion of a \nMATCH.  \nA. CORAL A, C, F, and H are scored because they meet criteria A. \nB. CORAL B and G are scored because they meet criteria B. \nC. CORAL D and E do not meet any criteria for trough scoring. \n \nA CORAL is scored on L2-L4 BRANCH if the BRANCH is inside the volume of the CORAL and the CORAL is not \nin contact with a ROBOT on that ALLIANCE or an ALGAE. Only 1 CORAL can be scored per BRANCH. \nAn ALGAE is scored in a PROCESSOR once it has passed through the opening of the PROCESSOR and by the \nsensor array. An ALGAE is scored in a NET if it is above the NET and within the perimeter of the NET, \ncontacting the NET or ALGAE contacting the NET, and not in contact with a ROBOT on that ALLIANCE. \nIf a CORAL scored in AUTO gets removed from a BRANCH during TELEOP, the AUTO points are removed but \nthe CORAL will still count towards the AUTO RP. If a CORAL is scored in that location again, the AUTO points \nassociated with the original scored CORAL is restored. CORAL scored in the trough is not tracked by specific \nlocation, if a CORAL is removed from the trough after AUTO, the points removed will correspond to the lowest \nscoring CORAL (i.e. TELEOP CORAL removed first); if CORAL is re-scored in the trough, points will be re-added \nin the reverse order (i.e. AUTO CORAL re-added first). \n6.5.2 ROBOT Scoring Criteria \nTo qualify for LEAVE points, a ROBOT must move such that its BUMPERS no longer overlap its ROBOT \nSTARTING LINE at the end of AUTO.  \nTo qualify for PARK points, a ROBOT\u2019S BUMPERS must be partially or completely contained in their BARGE \nZONE at the end of the MATCH and does not meet the criteria for CAGE points. \n\n \nSection 6 Game Details \nV13 \n49 of 164 \nTo qualify for CAGE points, a ROBOT must be contacting one and only one of their ALLIANCE\u2019S CAGES (and \nnot touching any ANCHOR), not contacting the carpet, and may additionally contact only the following \nelements: \nA. SCORING ELEMENTS, \nB. another ROBOT qualified for CAGE points,  \nC. a partner ROBOT contacted by an opponent in violation of G428, and \nD. an opponent ROBOT. \n6.5.3 Coopertition Bonus \nIn Qualification MATCHES, if at least 2 ALGAE are scored in each ALLIANCE\u2019S PROCESSOR, all teams earn 1 \nCoopertition Point, and the threshold for the CORAL RP decreases as described in Table 6-2. \nSee section 10.5.3 Qualification Ranking for more information about Coopertition influence on Qualification \nRanking order. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n--- Section: 6.5.1 SCORING ELEMENT Scoring Criteria (Page 47) ---\n \nSection 6 Game Details \nV13 \n47 of 164 \nLINE, score SCORING ELEMENTS, and retrieve SCORING ELEMENTS.

If it is not a quick \nremedy, DISABLED and, at the discretion of the Head REFEREE, must be re-inspected. If a ROBOT not \ncompliant with part B or C participates, its team receives a RED CARD. \nIf a ROBOT is BYPASSED prior to the start of the MATCH, the DRIVE TEAM may \nnot remove the ROBOT from the FIELD without permission from the Head \nREFEREE or the FTA. \nFor assessment of many of the items listed above, the Head REFEREE is likely to \nconsult with the LRI. \n7.4 In-MATCH \nRules in this section pertain to game play once a MATCH begins.  \n7.4.1 AUTO \nThe AUTO period is the first 15 seconds of the MATCH, and the FMS blocks any DRIVER control, so ROBOTS \noperate with only their pre-programmed instructions. Rules in this section apply only during the AUTO period.  \nG401 *Behind the lines. In AUTO, each DRIVE TEAM member must remain in their staged areas. A DRIVE \nTEAM member staged behind a HUMAN STARTING LINE may not contact anything in front of that \nHUMAN STARTING LINE, unless for personal or equipment safety, to press the E-Stop or A-Stop, or \ngranted permission by a Head REFEREE or FTA.  \nViolation: MINOR FOUL regardless of the number of items contacted. \nPointing, gesturing, or otherwise extending across the HUMAN STARTING LINE \nsuch that contact is not made with carpet or other ARENA elements is not a \nviolation of this rule. \nAn example of an exception for equipment safety is if an OPERATOR CONSOLE \nstarts to fall from, or has already fallen off of, the DRIVER STATION shelf. In that \ncircumstance, DRIVE TEAM members may step forward to catch it or pick it up \noff the ground and return it to the shelf. \nG402 *Let the ROBOT do its thing. In AUTO, a DRIVE TEAM member may not directly or indirectly interact \nwith a ROBOT or an OPERATOR CONSOLE unless for personal safety, OPERATOR CONSOLE safety, or \npressing an E-Stop or A-Stop. A HUMAN PLAYER feeding CORAL to a ROBOT is an exception to this \nrule.  \nViolation: MINOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD  \nG403 Limited AUTO opponent interaction. In AUTO, a ROBOT whose BUMPERS are completely across the \nBARGE ZONE (i.e. to the opposite side of the BARGE ZONE from its ROBOT STARTING LINE) may not \ncontact an opponent ROBOT (either directly or transitively through a SCORING ELEMENT CONTROLLED \nby either ROBOT and regardless of who initiates contact).  \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL and VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during the event. \nG404 No throwing in AUTO. In AUTO, a HUMAN PLAYER may not enter ALGAE onto the field.  \nViolation: MINOR FOUL. \nG405 No opponents CAGES in AUTO. In AUTO, a ROBOT may not contact an opposing ALLIANCE\u2019s CAGE.  \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL. \n\n \nSection 7 Game Rules (G) \nV11 \n66 of 164 \n7.4.2 SCORING ELEMENTS \nG406 *ROBOTS: use SCORING ELEMENTS as directed. A ROBOT may not deliberately use a SCORING \nELEMENT in an attempt to ease or amplify a challenge associated with a FIELD element.  \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL.  \nExamples include, but are not limited to:  \nA. launching SCORING ELEMENTS at ROBOTS, \nB. using SCORING ELEMENTS to elevate ROBOTS in an attempt to get on a \nCAGE, \nC. positioning SCORING ELEMENTS to impede opponent access to their \nPROCESSOR, \nD. Placing a CORAL into the PROCESSOR, and \nE. Using CORAL to dislodge ALGAE from the REEF  \nG407 *Keep SCORING ELEMENTS in bounds. A ROBOT may not intentionally eject a SCORING ELEMENT \nfrom the FIELD (either directly or by bouncing off a FIELD element or other ROBOT) other than ALGAE \nthrough a PROCESSOR.  \nViolation: MINOR FOUL. If REPEATED, MAJOR FOUL. \nG408 *Don\u2019t abuse SCORING ELEMENTS. Neither a ROBOT nor a HUMAN PLAYER may damage a SCORING \nELEMENT.  \nViolation: VERBAL WARNING. MAJOR FOUL if REPEATED in any subsequent MATCHES during the event. If \nvia a ROBOT and the Head REFEREE determines that further damage is likely to occur, DISABLED. \nCorrective action (such as eliminating sharp edges, removing the damaging MECHANISM, and/or re-\ninspection) may be required before the ROBOT may compete in subsequent MATCHES. \nSCORING ELEMENTS are expected to undergo a reasonable amount of wear and \ntear as they are handled by ROBOTS, such as scratching or marking. Routinely \ngouging, tearing off pieces, or marking SCORING ELEMENTS are violations of \nthis rule. \nG409 1 of each at a time. A ROBOT may not simultaneously CONTROL more than 1 CORAL and 1 ALGAE \neither directly or transitively through other objects. A ROBOT is in CONTROL of a SCORING ELEMENT if  \nA. the SCORING ELEMENT is fully supported by or stuck in, on, or under the ROBOT or  \nB. the ROBOT intentionally pushes a SCORING ELEMENT to a desired location or in a preferred \ndirection (i.e. herding).  \nA ROBOT pushing scored CORAL on level 1 while attempting to score other CORAL is an exception to \nthis rule. \nViolation: MINOR FOUL per additional SCORING ELEMENT. YELLOW CARD if excessive. \nExamples of interaction with a SCORING ELEMENT that are not \u201cCONTROL\u201d \ninclude, but are not limited to: \nA. \u201cbulldozing\u201d (inadvertent contact with a SCORING ELEMENT while in the path \nof the ROBOT moving about the FIELD) \nB. \u201cdeflecting\u201d (being hit by a SCORING ELEMENT that bounces into or off a \nROBOT) \nC. inadvertent contact with a SCORING ELEMENT while attempting to acquire a \nSCORING ELEMENT from the CORAL STATION. \n\n \nSection 7 Game Rules (G) \nV11 \n67 of 164 \nIt is important to design your ROBOT so that it is impossible to inadvertently or \nunintentionally CONTROL more than the limit. \nExcessive violations of CONTROL limits include, but are not limited to, \nsimultaneous CONTROL of 3 or more CORAL or frequent, greater-than-\nMOMENTARY CONTROL (i.e. more than twice in a MATCH) of 2 or more CORAL.  \nG410 No de-scoring. A ROBOT may not de-score a CORAL scored on the opponent\u2019s REEF.  \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL per de-scored CORAL and the opposing ALLIANCE is awarded the CORAL RP. \nG411 Don\u2019t put ALGAE on their REEF. A ROBOT may not deliberately put ALGAE on their opponent\u2019s REEF.  \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD. \nG412 Only throw CORAL if in your REEF ZONE. A ROBOT may not launch CORAL unless their BUMPERS are \npartially in their REEF ZONE. \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL. \nA CORAL is considered launched if it is shot into the air, kicked across the floor \nto a desired location or in a preferred direction, or thrown in a forceful way. \n\u201cBulldozing\u201d (inadvertent contact with a SCORING ELEMENT while in the path of \nthe ROBOT moving about the FIELD) is not considered launching. \nThis rule is not intended to penalize typical movement of CORAL outside an \nALLIANCE\u2019S REEF ZONE which come to rest a short distance (approximately 3 ft. \n(~92cm)) from the ROBOT. Examples of such actions could be but are not \nlimited to: \nA. Running an intake in reverse causing a CORAL to travel a short distance from \nthe ROBOT \nB. A ROBOT pushing a CORAL a short distance away in the process of herding it \nacross the FIELD \n7.4.3 ROBOT \nG413 *ROBOTS must be safe. A ROBOT may not pose an undue hazard to a human, an ARENA element, or \nanother ROBOT in the following ways: \nA. the ROBOT or anything it CONTROLS, e.g. a CORAL, contacts anything outside the FIELD except \nfor MOMENTARY contact inside the CHUTE,  \nB. its BUMPERS fail such that a segment completely detaches,  \nC. a corner of its ROBOT PERIMETER is exposed,  \nD. its team number or ALLIANCE color are indeterminate,  \nE. its BUMPERS leave the BUMPER ZONE REPEATEDLY or for more than a MOMENTARY amount \nof time, or \nF. its operation or design is dangerous or unsafe. \nViolation: DISABLED. \nExamples of dangerous operation or designs that likely pose undue hazards \ninclude, but are not limited to: \nA. uncontrolled motion that cannot be stopped by the DRIVE TEAM, \nB. ROBOT parts \u201cflailing\u201d outside of the FIELD, \nC. ROBOTS dragging their battery, and \nD. ROBOTS that consistently extend outside the FIELD. \n\n \nSection 7 Game Rules (G) \nV11 \n68 of 164 \nPlease be conscious of REFEREES and FIELD STAFF working around the ARENA \nwho may be in close proximity to your ROBOT. \nG414 *Keep your BUMPERS low. BUMPERS must be in the BUMPER ZONE (see R405).  \nViolation: MINOR FOUL.  \nG415 Expansion limits. A ROBOT may not extend more than 1 ft. 6 in. (~45 cm) beyond the vertical projection \nof its ROBOT PERIMETER.  \nIf the over-expansion is due to damage and not used for strategic benefit, it is an exception to this rule, \nand no penalty is imposed. \nViolation: MINOR FOUL, or MAJOR FOUL if the over-expansion is used for strategic benefit, including if it \nimpedes or enables a scoring action. \nExamples of compliant and non-compliant extensions are shown in Figure 7-2. \nROBOT A violates this rule for having an extension that is too long, while ROBOTS \nB, C, and D do not violate this rule. \nFigure 7-2 Examples of compliance and non-compliance of this rule (examples A and B are side views, \nexamples C and D are top views) \n \nThe intent of this rule is to prevent piling on a punitive response to a ROBOT \nthat\u2019s already experienced hardship and not leveraging that hardship for gain. \nExamples for this rule include the following:  \nA. \na physical device on a team\u2019s ROBOT, whose purpose is to restrain their \nCORAL scoring arm from extending beyond the limit, breaks after a \ncollision with another ROBOT. Provided the ROBOT does not use the now-\ntoo-long extension to score SCORING ELEMENTS, no violation is assigned.  \nB. \na vertical structural member of a ROBOT breaks at the bottom and rotates \nout such that it breaches the limit imposed. The ROBOT then parks such \nthat its extension blocks opponent ROBOTS from reaching their \nPROCESSOR. A MAJOR FOUL is issued.  \n\n \nSection 7 Game Rules (G) \nV11 \n69 of 164 \nG416 Don\u2019t damage the FIELD. A ROBOT may not damage FIELD elements. \nViolation: VERBAL WARNING. If the Head REFEREE infers that additional damage is likely, DISABLED. \nYELLOW CARD for any subsequent damage during the event. Corrective action (such as eliminating sharp \nedges, removing the damaging MECHANISM, and/or re-inspection) may be required before the ROBOT will \nbe allowed to compete in subsequent MATCHES. \nG417 Watch your FIELD interaction. A ROBOT is prohibited from the following interactions with FIELD \nelements with the exception of CAGES. \nA. grabbing, \nB. grasping, \nC. attaching to (including the use of a vacuum or hook fastener to anchor to the FIELD carpet), \nD. becoming entangled with, and \nE. suspending from.  \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL, plus YELLOW CARD if REPEATED, or longer than MOMENTARY. If the Head \nREFEREE infers that damage is likely, DISABLED. Corrective action (such as removing the offending \nMECHANISM, and/or re-inspection) may be required before the ROBOT will be allowed to compete in \nsubsequent MATCHES. \nG418 An Opponent\u2019s CAGES are off-limits in TELEOP. In TELEOP, A ROBOT may not contact an opponent\u2019s \nCAGE.  \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL and opposing ALLIANCE is awarded the BARGE RP if a Qualification MATCH. \nG419 ANCHORS are off-limits. A ROBOT may not contact the ANCHORS. Exceptions are granted for actions \nthat are inconsequential. \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL and the ROBOT is ineligible for CAGE points. \nThe intent of this rule is to disallow the use of the ANCHOR to ease the climbing \nchallenge.  \nExamples of contact with the ANCHOR that are considered inconsequential \ninclude, but are not limited to:  \nA. bumping into the ANCHOR during an attempt to climb \nB. inadvertent contact while attempting to PARK \nC. inadvertent contact while driving through the BARGE ZONE \nExamples of contact with the ANCHOR that are considered consequential \ninclude, but are not limited to: \nD. Reacting against the ANCHOR to lift off the floor \nE. Reacting against the ANCHOR to stabilize the ROBOT (It is possible that \ncertain interactions with the ANCHOR that absorb ROBOT energy may still be \nconsidered inconsequential.) \nF. Overtly contacting the ANCHOR to stop the movement of the CAGE (It is \npossible that certain interactions with the ANCHOR that absorb ROBOT \nenergy may be still be considered inconsequential.) \nG420 NET and contents are off-limits. A ROBOT may not contact either NET or any ALGAE scored in an \nopponent NET.  \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL. Additional MAJOR FOUL for each opponent ALGAE de-scored. \n\n \nSection 7 Game Rules (G) \nV11 \n70 of 164 \nG421 1 defender at a time. No more than 1 ROBOT may be on the opponent\u2019s side of the FIELD (i.e. \ncontaining the opponent REEF) with its BUMPERS fully outside and beyond the BARGE ZONES. \nViolation: MINOR FOUL, and for every 3 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a MAJOR FOUL is \nassessed. \n7.4.4 Opponent Interaction \nNote, G422, G423, G424 are mutually exclusive. A single ROBOT to ROBOT interaction which violates more \nthan 1 of these rules results in the most punitive penalty, and only the most punitive penalty, being assessed. \nG422 *Stay out of other ROBOTS. A ROBOT may not use a COMPONENT outside its ROBOT PERIMETER \n(except its BUMPERS) to initiate contact with an opponent ROBOT inside the vertical projection of the \nopponent\u2019s ROBOT PERIMETER.  \nViolation: MINOR FOUL. \nFor the purposes of this rule, \u201cinitiate contact\u201d requires movement towards an \nopponent ROBOT.  \nIn a collision, it\u2019s possible for both ROBOTS to initiate contact. \nG423 *This isn\u2019t combat robotics. A ROBOT may not damage or functionally impair an opponent ROBOT in \neither of the following ways: \nA. deliberately. \nB. regardless of intent, by initiating contact, either directly or transitively via a SCORING ELEMENT \nCONTROLLED by the ROBOT, inside the vertical projection of an opponent\u2019s ROBOT \nPERIMETER.  \nDamage or functional impairment because of contact with a tipped-over opponent ROBOT, which is not \nperceived by a REFEREE to be deliberate, is not a violation of this rule. \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD, or if opponent ROBOT is unable to drive, then MAJOR FOUL \nand RED CARD. \nFIRST Robotics Competition can be a full-contact competition and may include \nrigorous game play. While this rule aims to limit severe damage to ROBOTS, \nteams should design their ROBOTS to be robust. \nExamples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to: \nA. A ROBOT leaves an arm extended, spins around to change course, and \nunintentionally hits and damages a COMPONENT inside the ROBOT \nPERIMETER of a nearby opponent ROBOT. \nB. A ROBOT, in the process of trying to quickly reverse direction, tips up on a \nsingle pair of wheels, lands atop an opponent ROBOT, and damages a \nCOMPONENT inside that opponent\u2019s ROBOT PERIMETER. \nC. A ROBOT high-speed rams and/or REPEATEDLY smashes an opponent \nROBOT and causes damage. The REFEREE infers that the ROBOT was \ndeliberately trying to damage the opponent\u2019s ROBOT. \nExamples of functionally impairing another ROBOT include, but are not limited to: \nD. opening an opponent\u2019s relief valve such that the opponent\u2019s air pressure \ndrops and \nE. powering off an opponent\u2019s ROBOT (this example also clearly results in a RED \nCARD because the ROBOT is no longer able to drive). \n\n \nSection 7 Game Rules (G) \nV11 \n71 of 164 \nAt the conclusion of the MATCH, the Head REFEREE may elect to visually inspect \na ROBOT to confirm violations of this rule made during a MATCH and remove the \nviolation if the damage cannot be verified. \nFor the purposes of this rule, \u201cinitiating contact\u201d requires movement towards an \nopponent ROBOT.  \nIn a collision, it\u2019s possible for both ROBOTS to initiate contact. \n\"Unable to drive\" means that because of the incident, the DRIVER can no longer \ndrive to a desired location in a reasonable time (generally). For example, if a \nROBOT can only move in circles, or can only move extremely slowly, the ROBOT \nis considered unable to drive. \nG424 *Don\u2019t tip or entangle. A ROBOT may not deliberately, attach to, tip, or entangle with an opponent \nROBOT.  \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD, or if CONTINUOUS or opponent ROBOT is unable to drive, \nthen MAJOR FOUL and RED CARD.  \nExamples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to: \nA. using a wedge-like MECHANISM to tip over opponent ROBOTS, \nB. making BUMPER-to-BUMPER contact with an opponent ROBOT that is \nattempting to right itself after previously falling over and causing them to fall \nover again, and  \nC. causing an opponent ROBOT to tip over by contacting the ROBOT after it \nstarts to tip if, in the judgement of the REFEREE, that contact could have been \navoided. \nTipping as an unintended consequence of normal ROBOT to ROBOT interaction, \nincluding single BUMPER to BUMPER hits that result in a ROBOT tipping, is not a \nviolation of this rule. \n\"Unable to drive\" means that because of the incident, the DRIVER can no longer \ndrive to a desired location in a reasonable time (generally). For example, if a \nROBOT can only move in circles, or can only move extremely slowly, the ROBOT \nis considered unable to drive. \nG425 *There\u2019s a 3-count on PINS. A ROBOT may not PIN an opponent\u2019s ROBOT for more than 3 seconds. A \nROBOT is PINNING if it is preventing the movement of an opponent ROBOT by contact, either direct or \ntransitive (such as against a FIELD element). A PIN count ends once any of the following criteria below \nare met:  \nA. the ROBOTS have separated by at least 6 ft. (~183 cm) from each other for more than 3 \nseconds, \nB. either ROBOT has moved 6 ft. from where the PIN initiated for more than 3 seconds, or \nC. the PINNING ROBOT gets PINNED.  \nFor criteria A, the PIN count pauses once ROBOTS are separated by 6 ft. until either the PIN ends or the \nPINNING ROBOT moves back within 6 ft., at which point the PIN count is resumed.  \nFor criteria B, the PIN count pauses once either ROBOT has moved 6ft from where the PIN initiated until \nthe PIN ends or until both ROBOTS move back within 6ft., at which point the PIN count is resumed. \nViolation: MINOR FOUL, and for every 3 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a MAJOR FOUL is \nassessed. \n\n \nSection 7 Game Rules (G) \nV11 \n72 of 164 \nA team\u2019s desired direction of travel is not a consideration when determining if a \nROBOT is PINNED. \nG426 *Don\u2019t collude with your partners to shut down major parts of game play. 2 or more ROBOTS that \nappear to a REFEREE to be working together may not isolate or close off any major element of MATCH \nplay.  \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL, and for every 3 seconds in which the situation is not corrected, a MAJOR FOUL is \nassessed. \nExamples of violations of this rule include, but are not limited to:  \nA. shutting down access to all SCORING ELEMENTS,   \nB. quarantining all opponents to a small area of the FIELD,  \nC. blocking all access to the opponent\u2019s PROCESSOR, and  \nD. blocking all access to the opponent\u2019s CAGES. \nA single ROBOT blocking access to a particular area of the FIELD is not a \nviolation of this rule. \n2 ROBOTS independently playing defense on 2 opponent ROBOTS is not a \nviolation of this rule.  \nG427 ZONE protection. A ROBOT may not contact, directly or transitively through a SCORING ELEMENT, an \nopponent ROBOT partially or fully inside the opponent\u2019s BARGE ZONE or REEF ZONE regardless of who \ninitiates contact.  \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL. \nROBOTS that contact each other while in their respective BARGE ZONES may \nresult in a violation for both ALLIANCES \nG428 CAGE protection. A ROBOT may not contact, directly or transitively through a SCORING ELEMENT, an \nopponent ROBOT in contact with an opponent CAGE during the last 20 seconds regardless of who \ninitiates contact.  \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL and the opponent ALLIANCE is awarded the BARGE RP \n7.4.5 Human \nG429 *No wandering. A DRIVE TEAM member must remain in their designated area as follows:  \nA. DRIVERS and COACHES may not contact anything outside their ALLIANCE AREA, \nB. a DRIVER must use the OPERATOR CONSOLE in the DRIVER STATION to which they are \nassigned, as indicated on the team sign,  \nC. a HUMAN PLAYER may not contact anything outside their ALLIANCE AREA or their PROCESSOR \nAREA, and  \nD. a TECHNICIAN may not contact anything outside their designated area.  \nExceptions are granted as follows:  \nE. for a HUMAN PLAYER partially outside the ALLIANCE or PROCESSOR AREA,  \nF. in cases concerning safety, and  \nG. for actions that are inadvertent, MOMENTARY, and inconsequential. \nViolation: MINOR FOUL \n\n \nSection 7 Game Rules (G) \nV11 \n73 of 164 \nAn intent of item B is to prevent unsafe situations where long tethers to \nOPERATOR CONSOLE devices increase tripping hazards as the operator moves \nabout the ALLIANCE AREA. In the interest of avoiding nuisance penalties \nassociated with a DRIVE TEAM member stepping outside of a prescribed area, \nwe prefer to offer a general guideline as to what it means to use the OPERATOR \nCONSOLE in the ALLIANCE AREA. Provided the DRIVE TEAM member is within \nclose proximity of their DRIVER STATION, there will be no repercussions. \nHowever, a DRIVE TEAM member located more than approximately half a \nDRIVER STATION width away from their own DRIVER STATION while using their \nOPERATOR CONSOLE is likely violating this rule. \nG430 *COACHES and other teams: hands off the controls. A ROBOT shall be operated only by the DRIVERS \nand/or HUMAN PLAYERS of that team. A COACH activating their E-Stop or A-Stop is the exception to \nthis rule. \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL. RED CARD if greater-than-MOMENTARY. \nExceptions may be made before a MATCH for major conflicts, e.g. religious \nholidays, major testing, transportations issues, etc. \nG431 *DRIVE TEAMS, watch your reach. A DRIVE TEAM member may not extend into the CHUTE.   \nViolation: MINOR FOUL.  \nG432 *Humans: use SCORING ELEMENTS as directed. A DRIVE TEAM member may not deliberately use a \nSCORING ELEMENT in an attempt to ease or amplify a challenge associated with a FIELD element.   \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL.  \nExamples include, but are not limited to: \nA. a HUMAN PLAYER uses an ALGAE to disrupt an opponent ROBOT \nG433 *SCORING ELEMENT delivery. SCORING ELEMENTS may only be entered onto the FIELD as follows:  \nA. CORAL may only be introduced to the FIELD by a HUMAN PLAYER or DRIVER through the CORAL \nSTATION and \nB. ALGAE may only be entered onto the FIELD by a HUMAN PLAYER in their PROCESSOR AREA. \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL.  \nG434 *COACHES, SCORING ELEMENTS are off limits. COACHES may not touch SCORING ELEMENTS, unless \nfor safety purposes. \nViolation: MINOR FOUL. \nG435 The PROCESSOR AREA has a storage limit. HUMAN PLAYERS may not store more than 4 ALGAE in the \nPROCESSOR AREA. ALGAE can only be stored in the following locations: \nA. 3 in the holders on top of the PROCESSOR, and  \nB. 1 at the end of the PROCESSOR exit ramp  \nHUMAN PLAYERS making a good-faith effort to immediately move or enter additional ALGAE is an \nexception to this rule.  \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL per additional ALGAE. \n\n\n\n--- Section: 7.4.1 AUTO (Page 65) ---\n \nSection 7 Game Rules (G) \nV11 \n65 of 164 \nViolation: If fix is a quick remedy, the MATCH won\u2019t start until all requirements are met. If it is not a quick \nremedy, DISABLED and, at the discretion of the Head REFEREE, must be re-inspected. If a ROBOT not \ncompliant with part B or C participates, its team receives a RED CARD. \nIf a ROBOT is BYPASSED prior to the start of the MATCH, the DRIVE TEAM may \nnot remove the ROBOT from the FIELD without permission from the Head \nREFEREE or the FTA. \nFor assessment of many of the items listed above, the Head REFEREE is likely to \nconsult with the LRI. \n7.4 In-MATCH \nRules in this section pertain to game play once a MATCH begins.  \n7.4.1 AUTO \nThe AUTO period is the first 15 seconds of the MATCH, and the FMS blocks any DRIVER control, so ROBOTS \noperate with only their pre-programmed instructions. Rules in this section apply only during the AUTO period.  \nG401 *Behind the lines. In AUTO, each DRIVE TEAM member must remain in their staged areas. A DRIVE \nTEAM member staged behind a HUMAN STARTING LINE may not contact anything in front of that \nHUMAN STARTING LINE, unless for personal or equipment safety, to press the E-Stop or A-Stop, or \ngranted permission by a Head REFEREE or FTA.  \nViolation: MINOR FOUL regardless of the number of items contacted. \nPointing, gesturing, or otherwise extending across the HUMAN STARTING LINE \nsuch that contact is not made with carpet or other ARENA elements is not a \nviolation of this rule. \nAn example of an exception for equipment safety is if an OPERATOR CONSOLE \nstarts to fall from, or has already fallen off of, the DRIVER STATION shelf. In that \ncircumstance, DRIVE TEAM members may step forward to catch it or pick it up \noff the ground and return it to the shelf. \nG402 *Let the ROBOT do its thing. In AUTO, a DRIVE TEAM member may not directly or indirectly interact \nwith a ROBOT or an OPERATOR CONSOLE unless for personal safety, OPERATOR CONSOLE safety, or \npressing an E-Stop or A-Stop. A HUMAN PLAYER feeding CORAL to a ROBOT is an exception to this \nrule.  \nViolation: MINOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD  \nG403 Limited AUTO opponent interaction. In AUTO, a ROBOT whose BUMPERS are completely across the \nBARGE ZONE (i.e. to the opposite side of the BARGE ZONE from its ROBOT STARTING LINE) may not \ncontact an opponent ROBOT (either directly or transitively through a SCORING ELEMENT CONTROLLED \nby either ROBOT and regardless of who initiates contact).  \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL and VERBAL WARNING. YELLOW CARD if subsequent violations during the event. \nG404 No throwing in AUTO. In AUTO, a HUMAN PLAYER may not enter ALGAE onto the field.  \nViolation: MINOR FOUL. \nG405 No opponents CAGES in AUTO.

A ROBOT may not deliberately use a SCORING \nELEMENT in an attempt to ease or amplify a challenge associated with a FIELD element.  \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL.  \nExamples include, but are not limited to:  \nA. launching SCORING ELEMENTS at ROBOTS, \nB. using SCORING ELEMENTS to elevate ROBOTS in an attempt to get on a \nCAGE, \nC. positioning SCORING ELEMENTS to impede opponent access to their \nPROCESSOR, \nD. Placing a CORAL into the PROCESSOR, and \nE. Using CORAL to dislodge ALGAE from the REEF  \nG407 *Keep SCORING ELEMENTS in bounds. A ROBOT may not intentionally eject a SCORING ELEMENT \nfrom the FIELD (either directly or by bouncing off a FIELD element or other ROBOT) other than ALGAE \nthrough a PROCESSOR.  \nViolation: MINOR FOUL. If REPEATED, MAJOR FOUL. \nG408 *Don\u2019t abuse SCORING ELEMENTS. Neither a ROBOT nor a HUMAN PLAYER may damage a SCORING \nELEMENT.  \nViolation: VERBAL WARNING. MAJOR FOUL if REPEATED in any subsequent MATCHES during the event. If \nvia a ROBOT and the Head REFEREE determines that further damage is likely to occur, DISABLED. \nCorrective action (such as eliminating sharp edges, removing the damaging MECHANISM, and/or re-\ninspection) may be required before the ROBOT may compete in subsequent MATCHES. \nSCORING ELEMENTS are expected to undergo a reasonable amount of wear and \ntear as they are handled by ROBOTS, such as scratching or marking. Routinely \ngouging, tearing off pieces, or marking SCORING ELEMENTS are violations of \nthis rule. \nG409 1 of each at a time. A ROBOT may not simultaneously CONTROL more than 1 CORAL and 1 ALGAE \neither directly or transitively through other objects. A ROBOT is in CONTROL of a SCORING ELEMENT if  \nA. the SCORING ELEMENT is fully supported by or stuck in, on, or under the ROBOT or  \nB. the ROBOT intentionally pushes a SCORING ELEMENT to a desired location or in a preferred \ndirection (i.e. herding).  \nA ROBOT pushing scored CORAL on level 1 while attempting to score other CORAL is an exception to \nthis rule. \nViolation: MINOR FOUL per additional SCORING ELEMENT. YELLOW CARD if excessive. \nExamples of interaction with a SCORING ELEMENT that are not \u201cCONTROL\u201d \ninclude, but are not limited to: \nA. \u201cbulldozing\u201d (inadvertent contact with a SCORING ELEMENT while in the path \nof the ROBOT moving about the FIELD) \nB. \u201cdeflecting\u201d (being hit by a SCORING ELEMENT that bounces into or off a \nROBOT) \nC. inadvertent contact with a SCORING ELEMENT while attempting to acquire a \nSCORING ELEMENT from the CORAL STATION. \n\n\n\n--- Section: 7.4.3 ROBOT (Page 67) ---\n \nSection 7 Game Rules (G) \nV11 \n67 of 164 \nIt is important to design your ROBOT so that it is impossible to inadvertently or \nunintentionally CONTROL more than the limit. \nExcessive violations of CONTROL limits include, but are not limited to, \nsimultaneous CONTROL of 3 or more CORAL or frequent, greater-than-\nMOMENTARY CONTROL (i.e. more than twice in a MATCH) of 2 or more CORAL.  \nG410 No de-scoring. A ROBOT may not de-score a CORAL scored on the opponent\u2019s REEF.  \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL per de-scored CORAL and the opposing ALLIANCE is awarded the CORAL RP. \nG411 Don\u2019t put ALGAE on their REEF. A ROBOT may not deliberately put ALGAE on their opponent\u2019s REEF.  \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD. \nG412 Only throw CORAL if in your REEF ZONE. A ROBOT may not launch CORAL unless their BUMPERS are \npartially in their REEF ZONE. \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL. \nA CORAL is considered launched if it is shot into the air, kicked across the floor \nto a desired location or in a preferred direction, or thrown in a forceful way. \n\u201cBulldozing\u201d (inadvertent contact with a SCORING ELEMENT while in the path of \nthe ROBOT moving about the FIELD) is not considered launching. \nThis rule is not intended to penalize typical movement of CORAL outside an \nALLIANCE\u2019S REEF ZONE which come to rest a short distance (approximately 3 ft. \n(~92cm)) from the ROBOT. Examples of such actions could be but are not \nlimited to: \nA. Running an intake in reverse causing a CORAL to travel a short distance from \nthe ROBOT \nB. A ROBOT pushing a CORAL a short distance away in the process of herding it \nacross the FIELD \n7.4.3 ROBOT \nG413 *ROBOTS must be safe. A ROBOT may not pose an undue hazard to a human, an ARENA element, or \nanother ROBOT in the following ways: \nA. the ROBOT or anything it CONTROLS, e.g. a CORAL, contacts anything outside the FIELD except \nfor MOMENTARY contact inside the CHUTE,  \nB. its BUMPERS fail such that a segment completely detaches,  \nC. a corner of its ROBOT PERIMETER is exposed,  \nD. its team number or ALLIANCE color are indeterminate,  \nE. its BUMPERS leave the BUMPER ZONE REPEATEDLY or for more than a MOMENTARY amount \nof time, or \nF. its operation or design is dangerous or unsafe. \nViolation: DISABLED. \nExamples of dangerous operation or designs that likely pose undue hazards \ninclude, but are not limited to: \nA. uncontrolled motion that cannot be stopped by the DRIVE TEAM, \nB. ROBOT parts \u201cflailing\u201d outside of the FIELD, \nC. ROBOTS dragging their battery, and \nD. ROBOTS that consistently extend outside the FIELD. \n\n \nSection 7 Game Rules (G) \nV11 \n68 of 164 \nPlease be conscious of REFEREES and FIELD STAFF working around the ARENA \nwho may be in close proximity to your ROBOT. \nG414 *Keep your BUMPERS low. BUMPERS must be in the BUMPER ZONE (see R405).  \nViolation: MINOR FOUL.  \nG415 Expansion limits. A ROBOT may not extend more than 1 ft. 6 in. (~45 cm) beyond the vertical projection \nof its ROBOT PERIMETER.  \nIf the over-expansion is due to damage and not used for strategic benefit, it is an exception to this rule, \nand no penalty is imposed. \nViolation: MINOR FOUL, or MAJOR FOUL if the over-expansion is used for strategic benefit, including if it \nimpedes or enables a scoring action. \nExamples of compliant and non-compliant extensions are shown in Figure 7-2. \nROBOT A violates this rule for having an extension that is too long, while ROBOTS \nB, C, and D do not violate this rule. \nFigure 7-2 Examples of compliance and non-compliance of this rule (examples A and B are side views, \nexamples C and D are top views) \n \nThe intent of this rule is to prevent piling on a punitive response to a ROBOT \nthat\u2019s already experienced hardship and not leveraging that hardship for gain. \nExamples for this rule include the following:  \nA. \na physical device on a team\u2019s ROBOT, whose purpose is to restrain their \nCORAL scoring arm from extending beyond the limit, breaks after a \ncollision with another ROBOT. Provided the ROBOT does not use the now-\ntoo-long extension to score SCORING ELEMENTS, no violation is assigned.  \nB. \na vertical structural member of a ROBOT breaks at the bottom and rotates \nout such that it breaches the limit imposed. The ROBOT then parks such \nthat its extension blocks opponent ROBOTS from reaching their \nPROCESSOR. A MAJOR FOUL is issued.  \n\n \nSection 7 Game Rules (G) \nV11 \n69 of 164 \nG416 Don\u2019t damage the FIELD. A ROBOT may not damage FIELD elements. \nViolation: VERBAL WARNING. If the Head REFEREE infers that additional damage is likely, DISABLED. \nYELLOW CARD for any subsequent damage during the event. Corrective action (such as eliminating sharp \nedges, removing the damaging MECHANISM, and/or re-inspection) may be required before the ROBOT will \nbe allowed to compete in subsequent MATCHES. \nG417 Watch your FIELD interaction. A ROBOT is prohibited from the following interactions with FIELD \nelements with the exception of CAGES. \nA. grabbing, \nB. grasping, \nC. attaching to (including the use of a vacuum or hook fastener to anchor to the FIELD carpet), \nD. becoming entangled with, and \nE. suspending from.  \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL, plus YELLOW CARD if REPEATED, or longer than MOMENTARY. If the Head \nREFEREE infers that damage is likely, DISABLED. Corrective action (such as removing the offending \nMECHANISM, and/or re-inspection) may be required before the ROBOT will be allowed to compete in \nsubsequent MATCHES. \nG418 An Opponent\u2019s CAGES are off-limits in TELEOP. In TELEOP, A ROBOT may not contact an opponent\u2019s \nCAGE.  \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL and opposing ALLIANCE is awarded the BARGE RP if a Qualification MATCH. \nG419 ANCHORS are off-limits. A ROBOT may not contact the ANCHORS. Exceptions are granted for actions \nthat are inconsequential. \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL and the ROBOT is ineligible for CAGE points. \nThe intent of this rule is to disallow the use of the ANCHOR to ease the climbing \nchallenge.  \nExamples of contact with the ANCHOR that are considered inconsequential \ninclude, but are not limited to:  \nA. bumping into the ANCHOR during an attempt to climb \nB. inadvertent contact while attempting to PARK \nC. inadvertent contact while driving through the BARGE ZONE \nExamples of contact with the ANCHOR that are considered consequential \ninclude, but are not limited to: \nD. Reacting against the ANCHOR to lift off the floor \nE. Reacting against the ANCHOR to stabilize the ROBOT (It is possible that \ncertain interactions with the ANCHOR that absorb ROBOT energy may still be \nconsidered inconsequential.) \nF. Overtly contacting the ANCHOR to stop the movement of the CAGE (It is \npossible that certain interactions with the ANCHOR that absorb ROBOT \nenergy may be still be considered inconsequential.) \nG420 NET and contents are off-limits. A ROBOT may not contact either NET or any ALGAE scored in an \nopponent NET.  \nViolation: MAJOR FOUL. Additional MAJOR FOUL for each opponent ALGAE de-scored. \n\n\n\n--- Section: 10.5.3 Qualification Ranking (Page 122) ---\n \nSection 10 Tournaments (T) \nV6 \n122 of 164 \n3. minimize the number of times a team plays opposite any team \n4. minimize the use of SURROGATES (teams randomly assigned by the FMS to play an extra Qualification \nMATCH) \n5. provide even distribution of MATCHES played on blue and red ALLIANCE \n6. provide even distribution of MATCHES played in each DRIVER STATION number \nFor more information about the MATCH scheduling algorithm, please see Idle \nLoop software\u2019s website. \nAt events with fewer than 24 participating teams, the criteria are similar, however criterion 5 is changed to \nminimize the number of times a team swaps between the blue and red ALLIANCE rather than an even \ndistribution. \nAll teams are assigned the same number of Qualification MATCHES, equal to the number of rounds, unless the \nnumber of teams multiplied by number of MATCHES is not divisible by 6. In this case, the FMS randomly \nselects some teams to play an extra MATCH. For the purpose of seeding calculations, those teams are \ndesignated as SURROGATES for the extra MATCH. If a team plays a MATCH as a SURROGATE, it is indicated \non the MATCH schedule, it is always their third Qualification MATCH, and the outcome of the MATCH has no \neffect on the team\u2019s ranking. YELLOW and RED CARDS assigned to SURROGATES, however, do carry forward \nto subsequent MATCHES. \n10.5.3 Qualification Ranking \nRanking Points are units credited to a team based on their ALLIANCE\u2019S performance in Qualification \nMATCHES. Ranking Points are awarded to each eligible team at the completion of each Qualification MATCH \nper Table 6-2. \nExceptions to Ranking Point assignment are as follows: \nA. A SURROGATE receives 0 Ranking Points. \nB. A DISQUALIFIED team, as determined by the Head REFEREE, receives 0 Ranking Points.  \nC. A \u201cno-show\u201d team is either DISQUALIFIED from or issued a RED CARD for that MATCH (see G208). \nA team is declared a no-show if no member of the DRIVE TEAM is in the ALLIANCE AREA at the \nstart of the MATCH. \nThe total number of Ranking Points earned by a team throughout their Qualification MATCHES divided by the \nnumber of MATCHES they\u2019ve been scheduled to play (minus any SURROGATE MATCH), then rounded to 2 \ndecimal places, is their Ranking Score (RS). \nAll teams participating in Qualification MATCHES are ranked by Ranking Score. If the number of teams in \nattendance is \u2018n\u2019, they are ranked \u20181\u2019 through \u2018n\u2019, with \u20181\u2019 being the team with the highest Ranking Score and \u2018n\u2019 \nbeing the team with the lowest Ranking Score. \nTeams are ranked in order, using the sorting criteria defined in Table 10-1. \nTable 10-1 Qualification MATCH ranking criteria \nOrder Sort Criteria \n1st \nRanking Score \n2nd \nAverage Coopertition Bonus points \n3rd \nAverage ALLIANCE MATCH points, not including MINOR FOULS and MAJOR FOULS \n\n\n\n--- Section: 15 Glossary (Page 159) ---\n \nSection 15 Glossary \nV2 \n159 of 164 \n15 Glossary \nTerm \nDefinition \nACTIVE DEVICE \nany device capable of dynamically controlling and/or converting a \nsource of electrical energy by the application of external electrical \nstimulus  \nALGAE \na 16.25 in.
