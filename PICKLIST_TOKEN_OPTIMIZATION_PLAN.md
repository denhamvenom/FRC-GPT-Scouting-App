# Picklist Token Optimization Plan

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: December 17, 2024  
**Status**: READY FOR SPRINT 1  

## Overview

This plan optimizes the Picklist feature's token usage by 60-70% while maintaining full granular data precision and ensuring all teams can be compared. The approach focuses on data structure optimization rather than content reduction.

**CRITICAL: This system is completely agnostic to:**
- **Game Year** - Works with any FRC game (2020, 2025, 2030, etc.)
- **Event** - Works with any event (Regional, District, Championship, Off-season)
- **Game-Specific Metrics** - Dynamically adapts to whatever metrics are in field_selections
- **Custom Labels** - Handles user-added metrics seamlessly

The files `unified_event_2025iri.json` and `field_selections_2025iri.json` are used ONLY as examples to understand the data structure. The implementation must work with ANY year, ANY event, and ANY set of metrics.

## Current State Analysis

### Current Token Usage Breakdown
- **System Prompt**: ~2,000-3,000 tokens (game context + scouting guide)
- **User Prompt for 50 teams**: ~27,000-30,000 tokens
- **Total for 50 teams**: ~30,000-35,000 tokens

### Current Data Structure Issues
```json
// Current verbose format per team (~600-800 tokens each)
{
  "index": 1,
  "team_number": 10021,
  "nickname": "Guerin Catholic Golden Gears",
  "weighted_score": 7.5,
  "metrics": {
    "Auto Total Points": 1.33,
    "Teleop CORAL Scored in Branch (L2-L4)": 6.25,
    "teleop_coral_L1_scored": 1.0,
    "teleop_algae_scored_barge_processor": 0.0,
    "endgame_total_points": 8.0,
    // ... 15-25 more metrics
  },
  "text_data": {
    "scout_comments": "Bumper fell off. Tippy, took a while to place pieces",
    "auto_starting_position": "Mixed positions across matches"
  }
}
```

## Target State

### Optimized Compact Format (~200-250 tokens per team)
```
// Dynamic metric codes generated per event from field_selections
TEAM_INDEX_MAP = {1: 10021, 2: 422, 3: 4655, ...}
METRIC_CODES = {
  "AP": "Auto Total Points",
  "TCB": "Teleop CORAL Scored in Branch (L2-L4)", 
  "TC1": "teleop_coral_L1_scored",
  "TAB": "teleop_algae_scored_barge_processor",
  "EP": "endgame_total_points",
  "ASP": "auto_starting_position",
  "SC": "scout_comments"
}
AVAILABLE_TEAMS = [
  [1,"Golden Gears",7.5,[1.33,6.25,1.0,0.0,8.0,"Mixed","bumper|tippy"]],
  [2,"Storm",8.2,[2.1,4.8,2.5,1.2,6.0,"Center","consistent|fast"]],
  [3,"Mustangs",6.8,[0.5,8.2,0.0,0.5,12.0,"Right","climb|reliable"]],
  ...
]
```

### Dynamic Metric Code Generation
- Codes are generated at runtime from event's field_selections
- Common metrics across years get consistent short codes (AP, TP, EP)
- Event-specific metrics get intelligently abbreviated codes
- Custom user labels get codes generated on-demand
- All codes are included in the METRIC_CODES lookup sent to GPT

## Agnostic Design Principles

### 1. **No Hardcoded Values**
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Hardcoded for specific year/game
if metric_name == "teleop_coral_L1_scored":
    return "TC1"

# ✅ CORRECT - Dynamic generation
def generate_code(metric_name):
    # Extract key terms and abbreviate intelligently
    return abbreviate_metric_name(metric_name)
```

### 2. **Dynamic File Loading**
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Hardcoded path
data = load_file("unified_event_2025iri.json")

# ✅ CORRECT - Dynamic path construction
def load_event_data(year: int, event_key: str):
    filename = f"unified_event_{year}{event_key}.json"
    return load_file(filename)
```

### 3. **Flexible Metric Handling**
- Service accepts year and event_key as parameters
- Loads field_selections_{year}{event}.json dynamically
- Generates codes based on whatever metrics exist in that file
- No assumptions about metric names or structure

### 4. **Testing with Multiple Years/Events**
Tests should include various combinations:
- 2025iri (example provided)
- 2025lake (different metrics)
- 2024champs (previous year format)
- Mock data for future years

## Sprint Structure

This plan is divided into 4 focused sprints, each designed to fit within Claude's context window while maintaining continuity.

## Key Implementation Files

### New Files to Create
1. `/backend/app/services/compact_data_encoding_service.py` - Core encoding logic
2. `/backend/tests/test_services/test_compact_data_encoding.py` - Comprehensive tests

### Files to Modify
1. `/backend/app/services/picklist_gpt_service.py` - Prompt generation integration
2. `/backend/app/services/data_aggregation_service.py` - Add compact encoding support
3. `/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/picklist.py` - API integration if needed

## Data Sources Integration

### Using Existing Event Data
**IMPORTANT**: These are EXAMPLE files only - do NOT hardcode any values from them:
- **Example Structure**: `/backend/app/data/unified_event_2025iri.json` (shows data format only)
- **Example Mappings**: `/backend/app/data/field_selections_2025iri.json` (shows structure only)
- **Dynamic Loading**: Always load from `unified_event_{year}{event}.json` and `field_selections_{year}{event}.json`
- **Game Context**: Dynamically extracted for each year from GameContextExtractorService

### Metric Averaging Strategy
Follow the same approach used for multi-axis radar charts:
- Average numeric metrics across all matches for each team
- Preserve granular data during aggregation
- Handle missing data with appropriate defaults

## Expected Token Reduction Breakdown

| Optimization | Current Tokens | Optimized Tokens | Reduction |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|-----------|
| Team Data Structure | 25,000 | 10,000 | 60% |
| Game Context | 15,000 | 2,000 | 87% |
| Metrics Guide | 2,000 | 800 | 60% |
| Text Data | 3,000 | 1,200 | 60% |
| **TOTAL** | **45,000** | **14,000** | **69%** |

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Goals
- ✅ 60%+ token reduction for 50 team prompts
- ✅ Maintain full numeric precision (no performance banding)
- ✅ Preserve all qualitative text data (compressed but complete)
- ✅ Support comparing all teams simultaneously

### Qualitative Goals
- ✅ Ranking quality equivalent to current system
- ✅ All existing API functionality preserved
- ✅ System performance maintained or improved
- ✅ Code maintainability enhanced through modular design

## Context Preservation Strategy

Each sprint includes specific file references and focused prompts to maintain context across sessions:

1. **Sprint Handoff Files**: Specific files to read for context
2. **Focused Prompts**: Clear objectives for each sprint
3. **Success Criteria**: Measurable goals for each phase
4. **Documentation Updates**: This plan file updated after each sprint

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Loss Prevention
- Comprehensive testing with known datasets
- Reversible encoding validation
- Baseline comparison metrics

### Performance Validation
- Side-by-side ranking comparisons
- Token count monitoring
- API response time measurement

### Rollback Strategy
- Preserve original implementations
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Comprehensive test coverage
