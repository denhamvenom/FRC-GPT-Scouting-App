## 🎮 How It Works

### 1. Data Preparation
Load your scouting data (CSV/JSON), team performance metrics, and competition context:
```python
# Initialize with your dataset
generator = PicklistGeneratorService("path/to/unified_dataset.json")
```

### 2. Strategy Configuration
Define your alliance selection priorities:
```python
priorities = [
    {"metric": "autonomous_score", "weight": 0.3},
    {"metric": "teleop_avg_points", "weight": 0.4}, 
    {"metric": "endgame_points", "weight": 0.2},
    {"metric": "defense_rating", "weight": 0.1}
]
```

### 3. AI-Powered Analysis
Generate intelligent picklists with strategic reasoning:
```python
result = await generator.generate_picklist(
    your_team_number=1234,
    pick_position="first",
    priorities=priorities,
    exclude_teams=[9999]  # Teams unavailable for alliance
)
```

### 4. Strategic Insights
Receive ranked recommendations with detailed explanations:
- **Team Rankings**: Ordered by strategic fit and capability
- **Performance Analysis**: Strengths, weaknesses, and synergies  
- **Strategic Reasoning**: Why each team ranks where they do
- **Alliance Scenarios**: How different combinations would perform
