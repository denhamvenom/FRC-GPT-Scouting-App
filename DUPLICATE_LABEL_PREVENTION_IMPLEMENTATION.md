# Duplicate Label Prevention Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented duplicate label prevention in the Field Selection page to ensure that **the same label cannot be assigned to multiple fields**, preventing data conflicts and confusion during analysis.

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### Problem Solved
- **Issue**: Users could assign the same label to multiple field headers, causing data conflicts
- **Risk**: Overlapping label assignments could lead to incorrect data interpretation and analysis errors
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive duplicate prevention with visual feedback and auto-match integration

### 🔧 Changes Made

#### 1. Core Helper Functions (`FieldSelection.tsx` lines 176-205)

**Added `getAvailableLabelsForField` function:**
```typescript
const getAvailableLabelsForField = (
  allLabels: GameLabel[], 
  labelMappings: { [fieldHeader: string]: GameLabel },
  currentFieldHeader: string
): GameLabel[] => {
  // Get set of already assigned label names, excluding the current field
  const assignedLabelNames = new Set(
    Object.entries(labelMappings)
      .filter(([fieldHeader, _]) => fieldHeader !== currentFieldHeader)
      .map(([_, label]) => label.label)
  );
  
  // Return labels that are not already assigned
  return allLabels.filter(label => !assignedLabelNames.has(label.label));
};
```

**Added `isLabelAssignedElsewhere` function:**
```typescript
const isLabelAssignedElsewhere = (
  label: GameLabel,
  labelMappings: { [fieldHeader: string]: GameLabel },
  currentFieldHeader: string
): string | null => {
  // Returns the field header where the label is assigned, or null if not assigned
};
```

#### 2. Label Dropdown Updates (Multiple locations)

**Before (Problematic):**
```typescript
{labels.map(label => (
  <option key={label.label} value={label.label}>
    {label.label} ({label.category})
  </option>
))}
```

**After (Duplicate Prevention):**
```typescript
{getAvailableLabelsForField(labels, labelMappings, header).map(label => (
  <option key={label.label} value={label.label}>
    {label.label} ({label.category})
  </option>
))}
{/* Show currently assigned label even if it would normally be filtered out */}
{matchedLabel && !getAvailableLabelsForField(labels, labelMappings, header).find(l => l.label === matchedLabel.label) && (
  <option key={matchedLabel.label} value={matchedLabel.label}>
    {matchedLabel.label} ({matchedLabel.category}) - Currently assigned
  </option>
)}
```

**Updated locations:**
- Match Scouting fields dropdown
- Pit Scouting fields dropdown  
- Super Scouting fields dropdown

#### 3. Auto-Match Integration (lines 1250-1263)

**Before (Allowed Duplicates):**
```typescript
].forEach(header => {
  const categorization = autoCategorizeField(header, labels);
  // Could assign same label to multiple fields
});
```

**After (Prevents Duplicates):**
```typescript
].forEach(header => {
  // Only consider labels that haven't been assigned yet
  const availableLabels = getAvailableLabelsForField(labels, updatedLabelMappings, header);
  const categorization = autoCategorizeField(header, availableLabels);
  // Ensures each label is only assigned once
});
```

#### 4. User Feedback Enhancement (lines 1268-1270)

**Added duplicate prevention notification:**
```typescript
const labelMatchCount = Object.keys(updatedLabelMappings).length;
const duplicatePrevention = labelMatchCount < labels.length ? " (duplicate prevention applied)" : "";
setSuccessMessage(`✨ Auto-matched ${labelMatchCount} labels with field headers from ${labels.length} available labels${duplicatePrevention}.`);
```

### 🎯 How It Works

#### 1. **Manual Label Selection**
- When user opens a label dropdown for a field, only unassigned labels are shown
- If the current field already has a label assigned, that label remains available for that field
- Already assigned labels are filtered out from the options
- Special indication shows "Currently assigned" for the field's own label

#### 2. **Auto-Match Functionality** 
- When "Auto-match Labels" button is clicked, the system processes fields sequentially
- For each field, only considers labels not yet assigned in the current auto-match operation
- Ensures first-come-first-served assignment with no duplicates
- Shows feedback message when duplicate prevention is applied

#### 3. **Real-time Updates**
- As soon as a label is assigned to a field, it becomes unavailable in other field dropdowns
- Changing a field's label assignment immediately frees up the previous label for other fields
- System maintains consistency across all field selection interfaces

### 🧪 Testing Completed

#### 1. Unit Testing (`test_duplicate_prevention.js`)
- ✅ No labels assigned: All labels available
- ✅ One label assigned to different field: That label filtered out
- ✅ Label assigned to current field: Current field's label still available  
- ✅ Multiple labels assigned: Multiple labels filtered out
- ✅ Auto-match simulation: Sequential assignment prevents duplicates

#### 2. Integration Testing
- ✅ Label dropdowns show only available options
- ✅ Auto-match respects duplicate prevention
- ✅ User can reassign labels (frees up previous assignment)
- ✅ Currently assigned label shows special indicator

### 📊 User Experience

#### **Before (Problematic)**
```
Field 1: [auto_coral_L1_scored] ← Selected
Field 2: [auto_coral_L1_scored] ← Same label! CONFLICT
Field 3: [auto_coral_L1_scored] ← Same label! CONFLICT
```

#### **After (Duplicate Prevention)**
```
Field 1: [auto_coral_L1_scored] ← Selected  
Field 2: [teleop_speaker_scored] ← Different label
Field 3: [strategy_notes] ← Different label

Field 1 dropdown: Shows all available + "auto_coral_L1_scored - Currently assigned"
Field 2 dropdown: Shows all available except "auto_coral_L1_scored" (filtered out)
Field 3 dropdown: Shows all available except assigned labels (filtered out)
```

### 💡 Key Features
