# Service Contracts

**Purpose**: Machine-readable service specifications for AI development  
**Audience**: AI assistants, automated tools, and developers  
**Scope**: Complete interface definitions and behavioral contracts  

---

## Service Contract Framework

This document provides **machine-readable specifications** for all services in the FRC GPT Scouting App. These contracts enable AI assistants to understand service boundaries, interfaces, and behavioral expectations for autonomous development.

### Contract Structure
Each service contract includes:
- **Interface Definition**: Method signatures and parameters
- **Behavioral Contracts**: Expected behavior and side effects
- **Error Contracts**: Exception handling and error conditions
- **Integration Contracts**: How services interact with each other
- **Quality Contracts**: Performance and reliability expectations
