# Sprint 1 Session 1 Intent Document

## Session Overview
- **Sprint**: 1
- **Session**: 1
- **Start Time**: 2025-06-24 09:00
- **Planned Duration**: 2 hours
- **Primary Objective**: Create comprehensive safety infrastructure before any code changes
- **Success Metric**: All safety systems implemented and tested

## Baseline Reference Status
### Current Branch State
```bash
git branch --show-current     # refactor/sprint-1
git diff baseline --stat      # 0 files changed (starting fresh)
git log baseline..HEAD --oneline  # No commits yet
```

### Baseline Files for Reference
- **Primary Target**: N/A - Creating new safety infrastructure
- **Dependencies**: All backend services and frontend components
- **API Contracts**: All endpoints must remain identical to baseline

### Baseline Behavior to Preserve
Critical behaviors that MUST remain identical:
1. All API endpoints return exactly same JSON structure
2. Performance within 5% of baseline timing
3. Visual interface pixel-perfect match
4. All existing user workflows unchanged

## Intent and Context

### WHY This Work Is Needed
**Business Context**: Previous refactoring attempt failed, need safety systems to prevent future failures
**Technical Context**: No rollback mechanism or visual regression testing exists
**Risk Context**: Without safety infrastructure, any refactoring attempt has 70-80% failure risk

### Previous Session Results
**What Was Completed**: 
- N/A - First session of new refactoring approach

**What Was Discovered**:
- Previous refactoring failed due to cascading changes
- Need comprehensive safety before touching production code
- Visual preservation is absolute requirement

### Current Understanding
**How Baseline Currently Works**:
The FRC Scouting App has:
- Backend FastAPI services in `/backend/app/`
- Frontend React app in `/frontend/src/`
- Multiple interconnected services and components
- No comprehensive test coverage
- No visual regression testing
- No automated rollback procedures

**Key Dependencies Identified**:
- FastAPI backend serving REST APIs
- React frontend with TypeScript
- SQLite database
- Multiple external APIs (TBA, Statbotics)

**Constraints and Limitations**:
- Zero visual changes allowed
- All API contracts must remain identical
- Performance must stay within 5% of baseline
- User workflows cannot change

## This Session's Specific Intent

### Primary Goal
**Objective**: Create comprehensive safety infrastructure including baseline metrics, visual regression, rollback system, and integration tests
**Why Now**: Must have safety systems before any production code changes
**Success Looks Like**: All safety deliverables created and functional

### Approach Strategy
**Chosen Approach**: Build all safety systems first, test thoroughly
**Why This Approach**: Lessons learned from failed refactoring - safety first
**Key Implementation Steps**:
1. Create baseline metrics capture system - 30 minutes
2. Implement visual regression testing setup - 45 minutes
3. Build emergency rollback script (WSL-compatible) - 30 minutes
4. Create integration test suite - 45 minutes

**Validation Plan**:
- [ ] Baseline metrics successfully captured
- [ ] Visual regression detects intentional UI changes
- [ ] Rollback script tested and working
- [ ] Integration tests cover critical paths

### Alternative Approaches Considered
1. **Start refactoring immediately**: 
   - Pros: Faster initial progress
   - Cons: High risk of failure without safety net
   - Why not chosen: Previous attempt failed this way

2. **Manual testing only**:
   - Pros: Simpler to implement
   - Cons: Not repeatable, prone to human error
   - Why not chosen: Need automated validation

### What I Will NOT Do
- Modify any production code
- Change any API interfaces
- Alter any visual elements
- Skip safety validation steps

### Decision Framework
**If baseline capture fails**: Debug and fix before proceeding
**If rollback doesn't work**: Stop and resolve - this is critical
**If visual regression unreliable**: Investigate alternative approaches
**If integration tests incomplete**: Document gaps for next session

## Critical Context for Next Session

### Must Transfer to Next Window
**Essential Knowledge**:
- Location of all safety infrastructure files
- How to run baseline capture and validation
- Any discovered constraints or issues

**Decision Rationale**:
- Why specific metrics were chosen for baseline
- Why certain integration test scenarios were prioritized

**Open Questions for Next Session**:
- None expected - this session should be self-contained

### Next Session Intent
**Immediate Next Goal**: Sprint 2 - Canary Selection and Analysis
**Estimated Duration**: 1 day
**Prerequisites**: All safety infrastructure working

**Recommended Approach**: Analyze Team Comparison workflow for canary
**Alternative to Consider**: N/A - Team Comparison is predetermined

**Context Commands for Next Session**:
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/deila/Documents/FRC-GPT-Scouting-App/FRC-GPT-Scouting-App
git checkout refactor/sprint-1
python safety/baseline_metrics.py --verify
./safety/emergency_rollback.sh --dry-run
```

### Handoff Validation
**Before Next Session Starts**:
- [ ] All safety scripts executable
- [ ] Baseline metrics captured
- [ ] Visual regression operational
- [ ] Rollback tested

**Next Session Should Verify**:
- [ ] Safety infrastructure intact
- [ ] Baseline branch unchanged
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Session Execution Log

### Actions Taken
**09:00**: Session started, created directory structure
**09:05**: Created baseline and refactor/sprint-1 branches
**09:10**: Beginning baseline metrics implementation
**09:15**: Implemented baseline_metrics.py with comprehensive capture/verify functionality
**09:20**: Created api_contract_tests.py for API validation
**09:25**: Implemented visual_regression_setup.py with screenshot capabilities
**09:30**: Created emergency_rollback.sh - WSL-compatible rollback script
**09:35**: Implemented data_integrity_validator.py for data consistency checks
**09:40**: Created full integration test suite (3 test files)
**09:45**: Implemented progress_tracker.py for sprint tracking
**09:50**: Created comprehensive SAFETY_PROCEDURES.md documentation
**09:55**: Created run_safety_checks.sh to tie everything together

### Discoveries Made
**Git baseline branch**: Successfully created baseline reference branch
**WSL compatibility**: All scripts designed to work in WSL environment
**Playwright alternative**: Created manual screenshot capture option if Playwright unavailable

### Issues Encountered
**None**: All safety infrastructure created successfully

### Decisions Made
**Baseline branch strategy**: Created 'baseline' branch from current master for reference
**Error tolerance**: Set 5% performance tolerance for initial implementation
**Visual regression**: Zero tolerance policy for any visual changes
**Progress tracking**: Comprehensive tracking with go/no-go criteria
