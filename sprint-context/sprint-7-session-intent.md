# Sprint 7 Session Intent: PicklistGenerator Component Refactoring

## Objective
Refactor the PicklistGenerator component into 6+ focused components while preserving exact baseline behavior and visual structure.

## Critical Requirements
- **Zero Visual Changes**: Pixel-perfect preservation vs baseline required
- **Baseline Reference**: All comparisons against `git show baseline:frontend/src/components/PicklistGenerator.tsx`
- **Component Decomposition**: Break into 6+ focused, testable components
- **State Management**: Preserve identical patterns from baseline
- **Team Comparison Integration**: Maintain compatibility with already-refactored TeamComparisonModal
- **Custom Hooks**: Extract logic separation without changing behavior

## Scope Definition
**In Scope:**
- PicklistGenerator component decomposition
- Custom hooks extraction for logic separation
- Component interface preservation
- Visual structure documentation
- Baseline behavior validation

**Out of Scope:**
- Any visual changes or UI improvements
- State management pattern changes
- API contract modifications
- Performance optimizations beyond decomposition

## Key Deliverables
1. Session intent document (this file)
2. Baseline visual analysis document
3. Component decomposition strategy
4. Refactored component implementation
5. Custom hooks extraction
6. Comprehensive validation report
7. Handoff checklist for next session

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All baseline behaviors preserved exactly
- [ ] Component successfully decomposed into 6+ focused components
- [ ] Custom hooks extracted for logic separation
- [ ] Zero visual regression vs baseline
- [ ] Team Comparison modal integration maintained
- [ ] All component contracts documented
- [ ] Validation report shows 100% baseline preservation

## Context Window Management
- Document all decisions for next session handoff
- Preserve component contracts and interfaces
- Maintain visual preservation validation
- Create comprehensive handoff checklist

## Sprint Dependencies
- Team Comparison modal refactoring (completed in previous sprints)
- Baseline branch preservation
- Safety infrastructure (established)
