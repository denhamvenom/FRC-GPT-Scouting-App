## Baseline Extraction Commands

```bash
# Extract baseline version for reference
git show baseline:backend/app/services/picklist_generator_service.py > baseline_picklist_generator_service.py

# Analyze baseline characteristics
wc -l baseline_picklist_generator_service.py
grep "class\|def " baseline_picklist_generator_service.py | head -30

# Document baseline public interface
grep "def [^_]" baseline_picklist_generator_service.py | head -20

# Identify baseline dependencies
grep "import\|from " baseline_picklist_generator_service.py

# Count methods and classes
echo "Public Methods: $(grep -c "def [^_]" baseline_picklist_generator_service.py)"
echo "Private Methods: $(grep -c "def _" baseline_picklist_generator_service.py)"
echo "Classes: $(grep -c "^class " baseline_picklist_generator_service.py)"
echo "Total Lines: $(wc -l < baseline_picklist_generator_service.py)"
