## Sprint 5 Implementation Details

### Validation Strategy

#### **Multi-Layer Testing Approach**
1. **Infrastructure Layer**: Docker services, health checks, basic connectivity
2. **Service Layer**: Backend service imports, instantiation, dependency injection
3. **Component Layer**: Frontend builds, component structure, import resolution
4. **Integration Layer**: API endpoints, request/response cycles, error handling
5. **Workflow Layer**: End-to-end functionality, state management, user interactions

#### **Validation Commands Executed**
```bash
# Infrastructure validation
docker-compose ps
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health/
curl http://localhost:5173/

# Backend service validation  
python -c "from app.services.team_comparison_service import TeamComparisonService; ..."
python -c "service = TeamComparisonService('data/...'); print(type(service.data_service).__name__)"

# Frontend component validation
npm run build  # 5.96s build time, 63 modules, 393.34 kB bundle
ls frontend/src/components/  # All decomposed components present

# API integration validation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/picklist/compare-teams [with test data]
```
