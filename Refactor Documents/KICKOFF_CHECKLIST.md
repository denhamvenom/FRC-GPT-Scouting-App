### Process Validation
- [ ] **Sprint 1 objectives defined**: Clear, measurable goals set
- [ ] **Success criteria established**: Quantitative and qualitative metrics
- [ ] **Risk assessment complete**: Identified risks and mitigation plans
- [ ] **Rollback authority designated**: Who can authorize emergency rollback
- [ ] **Event timeline confirmed**: Test events scheduled and prepared

## 🔧 Technical Setup Verification

### Git Configuration
```bash
# Verify git setup
git branch --show-current  # Should be 'baseline'
git remote -v             # Verify remote access
git status                # Should be clean
```

### Python Environment
```bash
# Verify Python setup
cd backend
python --version          # Should be 3.9+
pip list | grep pytest    # Should show pytest and related tools
python -c "from app.main import app; print('✅ App imports')"
```

### Node.js Environment
```bash
# Verify Node.js setup
cd frontend
node --version            # Should be recent LTS
npm --version             # Should be 8+
npm run build            # Should complete successfully
```

### Baseline Integrity
```bash
# Verify baseline state
git diff baseline --stat  # Should show no differences
sha1sum backend/app/main.py  # Compare with checksum file
```

## 🎯 Sprint 1 Preparation

### Objectives Definition
Sprint 1 will focus on test framework setup:

- [ ] **Primary objective**: Install and configure pytest framework
- [ ] **Secondary objective**: Create initial test scaffolds for API endpoints
- [ ] **Success criteria**: 50% test coverage, all tests passing
- [ ] **Time allocation**: 2 days maximum
- [ ] **Deliverables**: pytest.ini, conftest.py, sample tests

### Resource Allocation
- [ ] **Developer hours**: [X] hours allocated for Sprint 1
- [ ] **Review capacity**: Code reviewers identified and available
- [ ] **Testing resources**: Test data and environments prepared
- [ ] **AI assistance**: Templates and prompts ready for use

### Risk Mitigation
- [ ] **Backup plan**: Rollback procedure tested and ready
- [ ] **Fallback timeline**: Alternative schedule if Sprint 1 fails
- [ ] **Support resources**: Technical leads available for questions
- [ ] **Documentation gaps**: All critical procedures documented

## 📊 Initial Metrics Collection

### Baseline Metrics
Run the metrics collection to establish starting point:

```bash
# Collect baseline metrics
python "Refactor Documents/scripts/collect_metrics.py"

# Generate baseline report
python "Refactor Documents/scripts/generate_dashboard.py"
```

### Expected Baseline Values
Document your starting metrics:

| Metric | Expected Value | Actual Value | Notes |
|--------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| Test Coverage | 0% | [ ] % | No existing tests |
| Service Count | 1 (monolith) | [ ] | Count service files |
| Max Service Lines | 1000+ | [ ] | Largest service file |
| API Endpoints | ~20 | [ ] | Count from routes |
| Build Time | Unknown | [ ] seconds | Time full build |

## ⚠️ Final Safety Checks

### Last-Minute Verifications
- [ ] **No critical deadlines**: No urgent features needed during refactoring
- [ ] **Team availability**: All key personnel available for Sprint 1
- [ ] **System stability**: No recent production issues or instability
- [ ] **External dependencies**: All third-party services accessible
- [ ] **Backup systems**: Data backups current and verified
