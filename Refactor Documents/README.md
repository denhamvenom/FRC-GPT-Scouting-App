## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### For Users (Non-Technical)
1. Read [USER_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md](USER_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md) - This is all you need!
2. Follow the simple step-by-step instructions
3. Paste prompts when instructed
4. Test the application and report issues

### For Project Leads
1. Review [MASTER_REFACTORING_GUIDE.md](MASTER_REFACTORING_GUIDE.md) for the approach
2. Ensure user understands their limited role (prompts, testing, error reporting only)
3. Set up baseline using [BASELINE_CREATION_GUIDE.md](BASELINE_CREATION_GUIDE.md)
4. Begin Sprint 1 using user guide prompts

### For Developers
1. Study [AI_PROMPT_GUIDE.md](AI_PROMPT_GUIDE.md) for AI interaction patterns
2. Understand [CONTEXT_PRESERVATION_GUIDE.md](CONTEXT_PRESERVATION_GUIDE.md) for session continuity
3. Follow [TESTING_STANDARDS.md](TESTING_STANDARDS.md) for all code changes
4. Know [ROLLBACK_PROCEDURES.md](ROLLBACK_PROCEDURES.md) for emergency situations

### For Claude Code Sessions
1. Use TodoRead to check progress at session start
2. Follow systematic tool usage: Read → Edit → Bash → TodoWrite
3. Use templates from [CLAUDE_CODE_SPRINT_TEMPLATE.md](CLAUDE_CODE_SPRINT_TEMPLATE.md)
4. Verify changes with Bash tools and update progress with TodoWrite

## 📋 Pre-Refactoring Checklist

Before starting the refactoring process:

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Development environment configured
- [ ] All dependencies installed
- [ ] API keys and credentials set up
- [ ] Docker environment working
- [ ] Git configuration verified

### Baseline Preparation
- [ ] Current system fully functional
- [ ] All existing functionality documented
- [ ] Performance baseline captured
- [ ] Baseline branch created and protected
- [ ] Initial metrics collected

### Team Preparation

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

If critical issues arise:

1. **STOP** all refactoring immediately
2. Run emergency rollback: `./scripts/emergency_rollback.sh`
3. Contact Technical Lead
4. Document the issue
5. Plan recovery approach

**Remember**: The baseline branch is your lifeline. When in doubt, return to baseline and reassess.
