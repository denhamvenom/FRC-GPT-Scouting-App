# FRC GPT Scouting App - Master Refactoring Guide

## Document Version
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2025-06-23
- **Status**: ACTIVE - This is the authoritative refactoring guide
- **Approach**: Risk-Mitigated Incremental Modernization

## Critical Requirements

### 1. Visual Interface Preservation
**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: The visual interface must NOT change from its current form.
- No color changes
- No layout modifications
- No font or styling updates
- No component reorganization
- All user workflows must remain identical

### 2. User Role Definition
The user's role is strictly limited to:
1. **Pasting prompts** to continue Claude Code execution
2. **Testing the front-end** through web browser interaction
3. **Pasting error codes** when issues occur
4. **NO coding or technical implementation by user**

### 3. Development Environment
- **Primary**: VSCode on Windows
- **Execution**: WSL Ubuntu Linux environment
- **Claude Code**: All refactoring done through Claude Code CLI
- **Scripts**: Must work in both Windows and WSL contexts

## Executive Summary

This guide consolidates all refactoring plans into a single, risk-mitigated approach based on lessons learned from the previous failed attempt. The plan prioritizes:

1. **Safety First**: Comprehensive safety infrastructure before any code changes
2. **Proven Success**: Canary workflow validation before expansion
3. **Visual Preservation**: Zero changes to user interface
4. **Clear Abort Points**: Well-defined go/no-go decision criteria

## Refactoring Approach: Incremental Modernization

### Why This Approach?
- Previous full refactoring failed due to cascading changes
- 70-80% failure risk with aggressive refactoring
- Incremental approach provides value even if partially completed
- Clear validation at each step prevents runaway failures

### Scope Comparison
- **Original Plan**: 30 sprints, complete system overhaul
- **This Plan**: 6-8 sprints, focused improvements
- **Success Target**: 20-30% system improvement with proven patterns

## Phase Overview

### Phase 1: Safety Infrastructure (2 Sprints)
Build comprehensive safety systems before any production code changes.

### Phase 2: Canary Refactoring (3 Sprints)
Refactor ONE workflow (Team Comparison) to validate approach.

### Phase 3: Incremental Expansion (3 Sprints) - ONLY IF CANARY SUCCEEDS
Carefully expand to additional components using proven patterns.

## Detailed Phase Plans

### Phase 1: Safety Infrastructure (Sprints 1-2)

2. Performance validation
3. Visual preservation verification
4. Go/no-go decision

**Decision Matrix**:
```
PROCEED to Phase 3 IF:
✓ All tests pass (100%)
✓ Zero visual changes
✓ Performance maintained
✓ Rollback tested
✓ No data issues

STOP Refactoring IF:

```

### Phase 3: Incremental Expansion (Sprints 6-8) - CONDITIONAL

**ONLY PROCEED IF CANARY 100% SUCCESSFUL**

#### Sprint 6-8: Gradual Service Expansion
Apply proven patterns from canary to 2-3 additional services/components.

## User Execution Guide

### For Each Sprint

1. **Starting a Sprint**:
   ```
   You: "Execute Sprint [N] of the FRC Scouting App refactoring following MASTER_REFACTORING_GUIDE.md and CONTEXT_WINDOW_PROTOCOL.md. 
   
   CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   - Reference baseline branch for all original code
   - Create session intent document for context preservation
   - Validate all changes preserve exact baseline behavior
   - Document decisions for next context window"
   ```

2. **During Execution**:
   - Claude Code will work autonomously
   - Will reference baseline code continuously
   - Will document intent for next session
   - Watch for completion message
   - Test as requested

3. **Context Window Management**:
   - Each session creates intent documents
   - Baseline behavior is continuously validated
   - Decision rationale is captured
   - Next session goals are documented

4. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Open application in browser
   - Compare against screenshots
   - Test all workflows mentioned
   - Verify NO visual changes from baseline
   - Report ANY differences

5. **Reporting Issues**:
   ```
   You: "Error encountered: [paste full error message]"
   ```

6. **Sprint Completion**:
   - Review summary provided
   - Test all changes against baseline
   - Verify intent documented for next session
   - Approve continuation or request rollback

## Emergency Procedures

### If Things Go Wrong

1. **Minor Issues** (UI still works):
   ```
   You: "Minor issue detected: [description]. Please investigate and fix."
   ```

2. **Major Issues** (UI broken):
   ```
   You: "EMERGENCY: System broken. Execute emergency rollback immediately."
   ```

3. **After Rollback**:
   - Verify system works
   - Document what went wrong
   - Decide whether to retry

## Scripts and Automation

All scripts are located in `Refactor Documents/scripts/` and are WSL-compatible:

### setup_refactoring.sh
- Works in WSL Ubuntu environment
- Handles Windows paths correctly
- Creates all required directories
- Establishes baseline branch

### emergency_rollback.sh
- One-command system restoration
- Works from Windows or WSL
- Preserves diagnostic information
- Returns to known-good state

## Success Metrics

### Per Sprint
- **Visual Preservation**: 100% (ZERO changes)
- **Functional Preservation**: 100%
- **Performance**: Within 5% of baseline
- **Test Coverage**: Increasing each sprint

### Overall Project
- **Minimum Success**: Canary workflow refactored successfully
- **Target Success**: 3-5 workflows improved
- **Stretch Goal**: 20-30% of system modernized

## Risk Management

### Highest Risks
1. **Visual Changes**: Any UI modification fails project
2. **API Changes**: Breaking frontend-backend contract
3. **Performance**: User-noticeable slowdowns
4. **Data Integrity**: Any data loss or corruption

### Mitigation
- Visual regression testing before deployment
- API contract testing on every change
- Performance benchmarks enforced
- Data validation throughout

Run emergency_rollback.sh and verify system restoration.
Document failure reason for analysis.
Create intent document explaining what went wrong for future sessions.
```

## Key Differences from Previous Plans

1. **Scope**: 80% reduction from original plan
2. **Risk**: Canary validation before expansion
3. **Visual**: Absolute preservation requirement
4. **User Role**: Clearly limited to testing
5. **Scripts**: WSL/Windows compatibility
6. **Abort Points**: Clear go/no-go criteria

## Final Notes

This plan is designed to:
- **Minimize risk** through incremental approach
- **Preserve functionality** with zero visual changes
- **Provide value** even if partially completed
- **Enable learning** through canary validation
- **Ensure safety** with comprehensive rollback

Remember: When in doubt, preserve the current behavior. The goal is internal code quality improvement, not user-visible changes.
