2. **Sequential Implementation**: Backend first, then frontend with continuous integration validation
3. **Session Management**: Comprehensive documentation for Claude Code context handoffs
4. **Integration Testing**: Ensuring frontend/backend work together at each step
5. **Security and Quality**: Maintaining focus throughout with automated enforcement

### Critical Lessons Applied
- **Interface Preservation**: All component interfaces and API contracts documented before changes
- **Visual Design Preservation**: Screenshots and workflows documented for exact replication
- **Sequential Refactoring**: Backend stabilized before touching frontend
- **Context Handoff**: Complete documentation for session transitions
- **Integration Validation**: Testing compatibility at every step

## Notes for User

This improved plan addresses all the critical failures from the first refactoring attempt:

1. **Preservation is Priority #1**: Visual design, user workflows, and component interfaces are preserved exactly
2. **Sequential Implementation**: Backend stabilized completely before frontend changes
3. **Integration Validation**: Testing compatibility at every step
4. **Session Management**: Comprehensive documentation for Claude Code context handoffs
5. **Quality Throughout**: Security and code quality maintained throughout

The plan is designed to be **conservative and methodical** rather than fast and innovative. The goal is to improve code quality and maintainability while maintaining **perfect functional and visual compatibility** with the original system.

**Key Success Factor**: Following the preservation requirements and integration validation at every step will prevent the cascading failures that occurred in the first refactoring attempt.
