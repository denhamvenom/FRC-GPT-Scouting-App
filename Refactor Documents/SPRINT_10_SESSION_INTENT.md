4. **Preserve Architecture** - Guidelines preventing architectural drift
5. **Enable Autonomous Development** - Self-contained task specifications

### AI-Specific Document Types

#### 1. **Service Interface Contracts**
```yaml
Service: DataAggregationService
Purpose: Unified data loading and preparation
Dependencies: [filesystem, json, logging]
Public Methods:
  - get_teams_for_analysis(exclude_teams, team_numbers) -> List[Dict]
  - load_game_context() -> Optional[str]
  - validate_dataset() -> Dict[str, Any]
Private Methods: [Internal implementation details]
```

#### 2. **Development Pattern Templates**
```markdown
## Adding a New Service Pattern
1. Create service class in app/services/
2. Implement standard interface methods
3. Add comprehensive logging
4. Create integration tests
5. Update orchestrator if needed
6. Document API contracts
```

#### 3. **AI Task Prompts**
```markdown
# Prompt: Add New Data Source Integration
You are adding a new data source to the FRC GPT Scouting App. Follow these steps:

1. Analyze existing data integration patterns in DataAggregationService
2. Create new service following established conventions
3. Add data validation and error handling
4. Integrate with existing caching layer
5. Update API documentation
6. Create comprehensive tests
