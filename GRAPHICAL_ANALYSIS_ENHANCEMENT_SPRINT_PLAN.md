**Integration Notes**:
- Component integrates seamlessly with existing GraphicalAnalysis page
- Uses same team selection and outlier exclusion settings as other charts
- Maintains consistent styling with existing components
- Proper error handling for missing data scenarios

**Bug Fixes Applied**:

1. **Data Structure Issue**:
   - **Issue**: ScoringDistribution component was receiving team metadata instead of full TeamData
   - **Root Cause**: GraphicalAnalysis was passing `availableTeams` (from `getAvailableTeams()`) which only contains `{team_number, nickname}`
   - **Solution**: Changed to pass `unifiedData?.teams ? Object.values(unifiedData.teams) : []` which contains full TeamData with scouting_data
   - **File**: `/frontend/src/pages/GraphicalAnalysis.tsx:721` 
   - **Result**: Distribution chart now receives proper data structure

2. **NaN Values Causing Recharts Crash**:
   - **Issue**: Recharts receiving NaN values causing `[DecimalError] Invalid argument: NaN` and app crash
   - **Root Cause**: Scoring calculations producing NaN values when data fields are missing or invalid
   - **Solution**: Added comprehensive NaN protection throughout data processing
   - **Result**: Chart renders without crashing and handles missing/invalid data gracefully

3. **Game-Specific Hardcoded Values**:
   - **Issue**: Component was hardcoded for 2025 REEFSCAPE game with specific field names and scoring values
   - **Root Cause**: Original implementation used hardcoded coral/algae field names and point values
   - **Solution**: Complete rewrite to be game-agnostic using field metadata system:
     - Uses `useFieldMetadata` hook to dynamically determine scoring categories
     - Filters fields based on metadata (data_type='count', description contains 'scored')
     - Dynamic color assignment from predefined palette
     - Dynamic sorting options based on available categories
     - Generic field access using metadata labels
   - **Files**: `/frontend/src/components/ScoringDistribution.tsx:1-449` (complete rewrite)
   - **Result**: Component works with any FRC game/year using event-specific field metadata
