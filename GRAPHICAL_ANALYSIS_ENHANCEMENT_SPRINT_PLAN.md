```
CRITICAL: Read /GRAPHICAL_ANALYSIS_ENHANCEMENT_SPRINT_PLAN.md first.

I need to implement Sprint 1: Consistency Heatmap for the Graphical Analysis enhancement.

CONTEXT: We're adding a heatmap chart to show team performance consistency across matches. The GraphicalAnalysis page already has radar charts working.

MANDATORY FIRST STEPS:
1. Read /GRAPHICAL_ANALYSIS_ENHANCEMENT_SPRINT_PLAN.md completely
2. Read /frontend/src/pages/GraphicalAnalysis.tsx to understand current implementation
3. Read /frontend/src/utils/chartDataProcessing.ts for data processing patterns

SPRINT 1 OBJECTIVES:
1. Create ConsistencyHeatmap component using React and CSS Grid
2. Add chart type toggle to GraphicalAnalysis page ("Radar" | "Heatmap" | "Distribution")
3. Process team scouting_data to create match-by-match matrix
4. Implement performance-based color scaling
5. Add hover tooltips showing match details

KEY IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- X-axis: Match numbers (chronological order)
- Y-axis: Teams (sorted by average total score)
- Cell color: Performance intensity (darker = higher score)
- Support separate views for Auto/Teleop/Total scores
- Handle missing matches gracefully (gray cells)

UI INTEGRATION:
- Add toggle buttons below chart title
- Use same team selection from existing UI
- Respect current metric selections for scoring
- Maintain responsive design

DATA PROCESSING:
- Extract match-by-match data from team.scouting_data
- Calculate scores based on selected metrics
- Normalize colors by match or global max
- Sort teams by performance metrics

MANDATORY COMPLETION:
1. Update Sprint 1 Completion Notes in this file with all changes
2. Mark each Success Criteria item with [x] as you complete it
3. Only check items that are fully implemented and tested
4. Document any unchecked items in completion notes

START IMPLEMENTATION.

- Missing match data handled with gray cells
- Hover tooltips showing team, match, value, match type, and alliance color
- Responsive design with horizontal scrolling for many matches

**Technical Details**:
- Color scaling: HSL-based with hue 0-120 (red to green), saturation 70-90%, lightness 45-60%
- Grid dimensions: Dynamic based on team/match count with min/max constraints
- Cell dimensions: 40-80px width, 30-50px height based on content
- Tooltip positioning: Centered above hovered cell with transform offset
- Data normalization: Global min/max or per-match maximum options

**Success Criteria Status**:
- [x] Heatmap renders with proper grid layout: COMPLETE - CSS Grid with absolute positioning

- [x] Integration with existing UI seamless: COMPLETE - Toggle buttons and consistent styling
- [x] Performance acceptable with 50+ teams: COMPLETE - Added performance optimizations and warnings

**Final Enhancements**:
- Added useCallback hooks for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implemented performance warning for large datasets (>50 teams or >50 matches)
- Added comprehensive error handling for missing data scenarios  
- Improved user feedback with contextual error messages
- Fixed unified data API 400 errors with proper event key validation

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Memoized cell lookup map for O(1) cell access

- Dynamic cell sizing based on content volume
- Efficient absolute positioning for smooth scrolling
- Warning system for datasets exceeding recommended limits

**Validation Results**:
